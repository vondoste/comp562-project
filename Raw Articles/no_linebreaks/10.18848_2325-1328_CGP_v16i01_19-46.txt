Developing Design Guidelines for Educational Built Environments that Meet the Sensory and Mobility Needs of Students with MS Mohjah Mohammed Alabdullah, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia Hala El-Wakeel,1 Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Saudi Arabia Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a cause of disability affecting patients' sensory abilities and mobility. Students with MS have no mental disability and should ideally be taught with other students, but an educational built environment designed to support their needs is necessary. The main objective of this study was to develop comprehensive Design Guidelines for the educational built environment for students with MS (DG-MS), to facilitate their independence and psychological and social integration with their peers. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, this study had two phases: Phase I involved developing preliminary guidelines for the environment from previous literature, accounting for the needs of MS students in areas such as main entrances, classrooms, vertical and horizontal circulation, and toilets. In Phase II, we measured satisfaction with the initial guidelines among high school students with MS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and assessed their environment based on responses. Results showed that students' dissatisfaction with their school entrance, circulation, classrooms, and toilets were 55%, 90%, 75%, and 80%, respectively. These findings show that new, necessary design criteria should be added to the initial DG-MS and be incorporated when designing new schools; furthermore, existing schools should undergo development to adapt to these new criteria. Keywords: Classrooms, Design Guidelines, Disability, Educational Built Environment, Multiple Sclerosis, High School, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Introduction ccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the concept of disability includes impairment in a person's body structure/function or mental functioning because of inherited or environmental factors that hinder the individual from carrying out certain activities and restrict their participation in normal daily activities (WHO 2019). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that causes disability, affects the nervous system, and partly or totally affects the sensory and mobility abilities of the patient. It is not accompanied by mental disability, but it often causes significant depression (Aljomah 2018). Many studies have stressed the importance of combatting depression among students with MS, which can be facilitated by not separating them from other students of the same age (Pottker 2014). In section 504 of the Human Rights and Amnesty International Act, primary and secondary schools, unlike higher education, must commit to identifying students with special needs within their jurisdiction's power and such students are entitled to assistance and services. There are many positive effects from the integration of students with MS with ordinary students, which emphasizes the importance of making adjustments to the educational built environment to meet their mobility, sensory, and psychological needs. In addition, this will guide the attitudes of community members, particularly school staff, teachers, students, and principals, to support the intellectual abilities of students with MS and help ordinary students accept them despite their circumstances (Pottker 2014). Studies have shown that patients with MS, when they reach high school age, become depressed as a result of their inability to go to school and complete their education, and some 1 Corresponding Author: Hala El-Wakeel, College of Design, Interior Design Department, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Eastern Provence, 1982, Saudi Arabia. email: hwakeel@iau.edu.sa The International Journal of Design in Society Volume 16, Issue 1, 2021, https://designprinciplesandpractices.com © Common Ground Research Networks, Mohjah Mohammed Alabdullah, Hala El-Wakeel, Some Rights Reserved (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

Therefore, it is important to have a built learning environment tailored to specific design guidelines that support the needs of patients with MS. To create an educational built environment designed to support the needs of patients with MS and other groups with special needs, it is important to determine design guidelines, measurements, and standards that meet their needs. Even with the advent of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the existing built environments still fail to meet the needs of people with disabilities (Jackson 2018). Studies indicate that disabled people's needs are poorly articulated in the design and development of the built environment as well as in regulatory controls (Imrie and Kumar 2010). There are internationally agreed-upon design principles and standards that meet the needs of people with disabilities. For example, Ron Mace created and defined the concept of "Universal Design," which is the design of built environments to be usable by all type of people (Mace 1985). However, MS patients, who have combined suffering from both sensory and mobility changes, are underrepresented in these design standards; thus, all of their needs are not met. For example, the appropriate handrail Although many studies have covered design criteria for some needs of patients with MS (e.g., ESCWA 2008; Helm et al. 2016; Polman et al. 2002), there are no comprehensive design guidelines and standards that cover all the needs of this group. It is precisely this gap in the research that this study addresses, aiming to answer the following research question: which holistic design guidelines for educational built environments (EBE) can meet the sensory and mobility needs of students with MS? Research Objectives The main objective of this study was to develop Design Guidelines for students with MS (DG- MS) that respond to the sensory and mobility needs of these students in an educational built environment, which will facilitate their integration into educational institutions, help them be independent, and help them be psychologically and socially compatible with their peers. This main objective was achieved with the following detailed objectives: Compile the standards and design guidelines supporting the sensory and mobility needs of patients with MS in an educational built environment from previous research. Determine standards and design guidelines that are not covered in previous research by consulting with patients with MS. Develop an initial version of the DG-MS and the principles necessary for supporting their sensory and mobility needs in the educational built environment. Test the initial version of the DG-MS by surveying patients with MS and specialists. Develop a final version of the DG-MS to support the sensory and mobility needs of students with MS in the educational built environment. Methodology This study utilized a mixed-methods approach: First, we reviewed existing medical literature and design guidelines for patients with MS in the educational built environment as a basis for developing appropriate design principles, that is, the initial version of the DG-MS (Phase I); then, we tested the DG-MS using a mixed quantitative and qualitative survey of students with MS in Saudi Arabia (Phase II). Phase I We developed a preliminary version of the DG-MS that supports the sensory and mobility needs of patients with MS in the educational built environment through a literature review of medical and design studies and primary sources and medical documents. Appropriate criteria and design principles were determined (i.e., qualitative or quantitative). The standards for each element of the educational built environment in which students spend most of their time were classified into the main entrances, classrooms, vertical and horizontal (V&H) circulation, and toilets. Then, we determined the ideal standard dimensions and measurements according to the needs of students with MS. Phase II We tested the initial version of the DG-MS and developed the final version by using a mixed quantitative (closed-ended questions) and qualitative (open-ended questions) questionnaire. We utilized Question Pro, an online data collection tool, to assess the educational built environment based on the DG-MS. The demographic characteristics of the participants were as follows: they were all female Saudi high school students with MS in 10th through 12th grades and between they were currently attending school or had attended school within the last three years in the eastern province public high schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Table 1 shows the calculation of the sample size. With the help of the Saudi National Society of MS, it was possible to contact 287 participants during March to September 2018; 255 (88.8%) of them agreed to participate, and 105 of them were excluded for not completing the questionnaire. The IRB-related approval of the participants was collected at the beginning of the questionnaires. Female students were selected because there are twice as many females as males among the 2.8 million people estimated to live with MS worldwide (35.9 per 100,000 population; MS International Federation 2020; Walton 2020); in the KSA, there are three times as many females with MS as males (Aljomah 2018 ). Furthermore, due to social restrictions in KSA, the researchers of this study were unable to visit male high schools, and male patients with MS could not be included in this study. Table 1: Calculation of the Sample Size for the Survey Sample size required (n) Size of research population (N) Chi-square (Level of confidence) (X2) Population proportion (P) Level of significance (Error rate) (d) 150 3000 3.841 (80%) 0.50 (5%) = 0.05 DG-MS Questionnaire Source: El-Wakeel and Alabdullah The questionnaire began with an explanation of its objective, that all of the information and identities would remain confidential, and that the study participants were free to refuse participation. Participants provided both written informed consent in the questionnaire form and verbal consent to the researcher before starting. The questionnaire was designed as direct questions divided into three sections as follows: Collection of biographical information, including medical history and age group; Measurement of the participant's satisfaction with their educational built environment, including satisfaction with the main entrances, classrooms, V&H circulation, and toilets. These questions were answered on a five-point Likert scale (5= very satisfied, 4= somewhat satisfied, 3= neutral, 4= somewhat dissatisfied, and 5= not satisfied). This part of the questionnaire measured the presence of design elements and identified both missing elements and the most influential elements. We analyzed the results of this section using mean and Chi-square to measure satisfaction levels and statistical significance. Analysis was performed using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS) version 22. Identification of the reasons for the participants's dissatisfaction through two sets of questions. The first set contained closed-ended questions with many specific choices of reasons for non-satisfaction, and the second contained open-ended questions to allow the subjects to write about their opinion and the obstacles they face. This part of the questionnaire helped us determine which aspects of design caused suffering among students with MS, the importance of each design element, whether it can be replaced, and what can replace it. The questionnaire was evaluated and tested for reliability and validity as follows: Review of the preliminary version: The questionnaire was reviewed in terms of the importance of the questions, affiliation with each section, and clarity. Four specialized PhD faculty and a statistics analysis specialist ensured the correctness of the method and verified the accuracy of the questions. The pilot study, testing reliability and validity: A total of 20 copies were distributed among high school-aged female patients with MS at King Fahad University Hospital. Reliability and validity were calculated for the second section of the survey. Internal reliability was determined by the coefficient of correlation between the question score and the overall score of the section. All questions had a high degree of satisfaction, and all correlation transactions were statistically significant at a level below 0.01. The reliability coefficients ranged from 0.788 to 0.938, and Cronbach's alpha = 0.965, indicating good reliability. The validity was determined by the coefficients between the sub-dimensions and the total degree of satisfaction score. All dimensions of satisfaction were significantly related to the overall degree of correlation at the level 0.01, as shown in Table 2. As the psychometric properties of the questionnaire were appropriate and acceptable, we then ensured that the survey was free of any errors. The survey was finalized after making all the modifications required after the pilot study, and the final version is included in the Appendix.

According to the American National MS Society, MS is one of the most serious diseases affecting the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord as well as visual nerves (Harmon 2016). It is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system affects the myelin that encapsulates neurons, leading to a defect in the transmission of messages and information from the brain or spinal cord to the rest of the body, and may even disrupt the mechanism of transmission of information completely (Aljomah 2018). The exact cause of the disease is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of immune, environmental, infectious, and genetic factors. It usually affects those aged 15–60 and is considered to be three times more dangerous to women than men (Jelinek 2016). MS can cause a variety of symptoms, and each patient's symptoms can change or fluctuate over time (Carter 2011). These symptoms generally include vision disorders, muscle spasms, limb numbness, bladder control problems, and difficulty speaking. Through the literature review, we identified the symptoms of MS that need to be taken into account during the design process. By adequately understanding these symptoms and their causes, the best possible recommendations can be found to support the needs of students with MS. Table 3 shows the most important symptoms and mobility changes in a patient with MS, including walking and balance problems, muscle spasms, nerve tremors, and speech disorder (Helm et al. 2016). Table 4 shows the most important symptoms and sensory changes in patients with MS, including stress, constant fatigue, pain, visual disorders, limb numbness, high fever, and bladder and bowel disorders (Helm et al. 2016). Table 3: Symptoms and Mobility Changes for MS Patients Symptoms Description Walking and balance Difficulty in walking is one of the most common mobility restrictions for MS, and walking problems are related to several factors: Muscle weakness Stress and muscle fatigue Muscle spasms Loss of balance Sensory deficit (numbness) Muscle spasms MS patients have a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms (persistent muscle contractions or sudden movements). Cramping may be as mild as feeling tight muscles or it may be so severe that it produces painful and uncontrollable cramps in the limbs. Cramping may also result in pain or tightness in and around the joints and can lead to lower back pain. Although cramping can occur at any end, it is more common in the lower limbs. Nerve tremor Many MS patients suffer from a tremor, or uncontrollable vibration. It can occur in different parts of the body. Speech disorder Speech disorders are common in MS patients. Speech patterns are controlled by the brain stem as well as many areas of the brain. Affects in different areas of the brain can lead to various changes in normal speech patterns. They range from minor to severe difficulties that make it hard for patients to speak and be understood. Source: Helm et al. 2016 Table 4: Symptoms and Sensory Changes in MS Patients Symptoms Description Stress and fatigue Stress and fatigue are the most common complaints in MS patients. Approximately 30% complain that fatigue limits their daily activities. Fatigue can happen daily and can get worse as the day progresses; it also comes and goes without warning, interfering with the patient's daily routine. This can be caused by several factors: Fatigue and stress that result from poor neural connectivity. This deterioration can occur suddenly, even after a full night's sleep, and tends to worsen throughout the day. Emotional disturbances, bladder symptoms, or other distressing physical symptoms can cause sleep disorders, leading to extreme fatigue during the day. Pain People with MS may suffer from acute or chronic pain, such as a stab wound to the face or burning, movement pain of joints and limbs, and an electrical sensation when bending the neck forward, which extends to the lower back and to the extremities. Visual disturbances Visual symptoms are the first kind of symptom in many MS patients, affecting approximately 80% of them. The three main types of visual symptoms are: Optic neuritis - causes temporary vision disorder, changes in ability to see color, and sometimes pain in the influenced eye. Double vision (diplopia) - is the reason for seeing duplicates of everything. Rhythmic jerking of the eye that the doctor may detect during a neurological exam, but which does not cause noticeable symptoms. Numbness of the limbs Numbness in the face, body, and limbs (arms and legs). High temperature High body temperature in MS patients is a common symptom as a result of permanent resistance to the immune system in the body. Bladder and bowel disorder A bladder disorder occurs, where MS patients feel the constant desire to relieve themselves. Source: Helm et al. 2016 The Effect of MS Symptoms on the Design of the Educational Built Environment A built environment, which is the purely physical elements that are tangible to the users and directly affect their performance, includes the following: temperature, colors, materials, distribution of space, circulation paths, furniture, lighting, space locators such as walls and windows, and technical equipment. Several studies have addressed the impact of MS symptoms on the design of the built environment in five design aspects: accessibility, unique needs, efficiency, navigation, and psychological welfare (Carter 2011). Accessibility Mobility. Not all patients with MS need a wheelchair, although all have mobility problems. Many of them may need walking aids such as canes or bendable sticks. Therefore, the design guidelines for circulation paths should include ramps and handrails to support these needs (The National MS Society 2010; Young, Parikh, and Layne 2020). Tremors and balance. Tremor symptoms occur in 75 percent of patients with MS, most of which are visible in the upper extremities. Tremors appear in two ways: total tremors consist of broad movements back and forth, and motion tremors occur when a person reaches for an object. Therefore, the width of supporting struts in circulation paths and the use of round edges should be considered to reduce injury (The National MS Society 2016; Polman et al. 2002). Spasticity. This refers to "hardening" muscles. This is a common problem faced by many patients with MS. Approximately 75 percent to 80 percent of them suffer from spasticity at some point. Therefore, circulation paths should be designed with, for example, handrails and non-slippery materials (Haselkorn et al. 2005). Vertigo. Patients with MS often feel dizzy and nauseated. Relevant design guidelines should be taken into account, such as the provision of vinyl floors with air pockets that reduce injury and also help patients regain balance (Polman et al. 2002). Unique Needs Numbness. One symptom of MS is tingling, which usually occurs in the hands and feet. This can be considered in guidelines for lighting switches and door and window handles with respect to size and materials. Bladder and Bowel Problems. A type of bladder weakness occurs in approximately 70% of patients with MS. Therefore, the location, height, and dimensions of the toilets and toilet handrails should be designed with patients with MS in mind (Polman et al. 2002; Young, Parikh, and Layne 2020). Efficiency Weakness. Increased pressure on muscles in patients with MS increases weakness. Therefore, design elements (e.g., door handles, windows, and shelves) should require little strength when used. Fatigue. Patients with MS suffer from fatigue and lack of energy. Therefore, slippery floors should be avoided, and vinyl floors or filling under wooden floors should be used to reduce the energy consumed by patients with MS during movement (Polman et al. 2002). In addition, seating can be provided in spaces where long standing times may be required (Kalb 2008). Navigation Vision. Vision disorders among patients with MS include optic neuritis, loss of color contrast, and double vision. Therefore, these symptoms need to be considered in the design guidelines for signs, and there should be sources of light at the stairs and in reading areas (Schapiro 2003). Psychological Welfare Depression. Depression affects 75 percent of patients with MS, so specific colors and lighting should be used to positively affect psychological states (Schapiro 2003). Design Guidelines for EBE Appropriate to the Needs of Patients with MS in Literature Several studies have attempted to determine the quantitative and qualitative criteria for educational built environment EBE design elements to suit the needs of patients with MS, but no single study has gathered all design guidelines. The areas where design criteria and guidelines are necessary, based on previous studies, are the main entrance, V&H circulation, classrooms, and toilets. Some previous studies have followed the method of trial and observation; they noted the impact of the design on the symptoms of MS to determine criteria that can help reduce the symptoms of the disease in the educational built environment (e.g., Carter 2011). Other studies changed design elements in the educational built environment and monitored the efficiency of each change based on the reactions of patients with MS (e.g., Helm et al. 2016). However, to our knowledge, no study has used statistical and observational evidence to determine the best design practices for the educational built environment for students with MS. Table 5 presents the design criteria and guidelines, compares the utility of the qualitative or quantitative feedback, and identifies the type of need (sensory or mobility) of patients with MS for each of the four main areas mentioned above. In addition, we have included the references associated with each criterion. The table also outlines the potential alternatives for some of the design criteria.

Underrepresented groups are often less willing to participate in research due to barriers such as mistrust, stigma, and competing demands (Cuccaro et al. 2020). This study also encountered these challenges, and this is a limitation to the current research. Of the 287 patients contacted by the researcher, 88.8 percent agreed to participate. However, only 58.8 percent of the participants completed the questionnaire in a valid way. The online questionnaire was circulated for 7 months (March– September 2018) to obtain an appropriate sample size. In addition, there were very few responses to the open-ended questions. Therefore, it was not possible to perform thematic data analyses to extract themes from the open-ended survey responses. Nevertheless, the obtained feedback responses provided some insight for the criteria selection and design guidelines in the development of the final version of the holistic DG-MS. The demographic summary of the participants revealed that 57.3 percent of the respondents had already withdrawn from school. Of these, 48.7 percent withdrew from the school because it was not fulfilling their sensory and mobility needs, including challenges with the built environment. The others withdrew for social or psychological reasons. Design Guidelines for the Main Entrance The main entrance in the educational built environment includes the main motion rush area, which has three components: passenger drop point, pavement ramp, and entrance ramp. Each component has a set of criteria that must be met to support the needs of patients with MS. There are thirteen total design criteria points for the main entrance, combining qualitative and quantitative criteria. The most important qualitative criteria needed for an ideal entrance focus on the material and color of the floors, the types of ramps used in the entrance, and the available design elements. The most important quantitative criteria focus directly on the dimensions of the design elements in terms of the appropriate width of the entrance and the slope of the rams. Although 55 percent of the students were dissatisfied with many elements of the main entrance, there appear to be more satisfactory elements in this section compared to the others. The statistical analysis showed that 38 percent of the students with MS who were not satisfied with the entrance did not complete their education and withdrew from high school because the entrance was not suitable for their sensory and mobility needs. These results were statistically significant (Chi-square = 9.71), which confirms that entrance design should be a key element in any design criteria for educational buildings used by students with MS. The satisfaction with the three components of the main entrance varied. The results show that there are significant design barriers in the pavement ramp area (50% dissatisfaction), the passenger drop-off area (32% dissatisfaction), and the entrance ramp area (22% dissatisfaction). Accordingly, the impact of each criterion on students with MS was reached and ranked by importance. This was accomplished by correlating each criterion statistical analysis in the second section of the survey with the reasons for dissatisfaction with the main entrance in the third section, as shown in Table 6. The open-ended question revealed the following four criteria for effective main entrance design: The doors of the main entrance should open in both directions. The material used for the main entrance door should not be reflective to avoid glare. Repeated patterns on the door or walls should be avoided. Glass opening(s) should be included in the entrance door so people can see others and avoid collisions.

It consists of three main components: elevators, stairs, and corridors. Each component has a set of criteria that must be met to support the needs of patients with MS. We determined 16 qualitative and quantitative criteria for the design of V&H circulation based on the findings of existing literature. The most important qualitative criteria needed for ideal V&H circulation focus on the material and color of the floors, the location of the elevator buttons, and the required design elements. The most important quantitative criteria focus directly on the dimensions of the design elements in terms of the appropriate width of the stairs, elevators, and corridors, and handrail heights. The results of the statistical analysis show that 75 percent of students with MS were dissatisfied with the V&H circulation in their school. The statistical analysis showed that 44 percent of the students with MS who were not satisfied with the V&H circulation did not complete their education, and withdrew from high school because the V&H circulation was not suitable for their sensory and mobility needs. The results of the statistical analysis also indicated that the differences between the ratios are statistically significant (Chi-square = 32.07), which confirms that the efficiency of the V&H circulation design should be a key element in any design criteria for educational buildings used by students with MS. The satisfaction with the three components of V&H circulation varied. The results showed that there are significant design barriers in the elevators (85% dissatisfaction), the stairs (70% dissatisfaction), and the corridors (60% dissatisfaction). Accordingly, the impact of each criterion on students with MS was reached and ranked by importance. This was accomplished by correlating each criterion statistical analysis in the second section of the survey with the reasons for dissatisfaction with the V&H circulation in the third section, as shown in Table 7. The open-ended question revealed the following three criteria for effective V&H circulation design: The functional relationship between the location of the elevator and the main entrance must be strong (e.g., the elevator should directly face or be next to the main entrance) so the elevator can be located and accessed easily and quickly. The functional relationship between the location of the staircase and the main entrance must be strong (e.g., the main staircase should be in front of or next to the main entrance) so the stairs can be located and accessed easily and quickly. The handrails attached to the corridors must have handles that are easy to use, and there should be a distance between the handrail and the wall of not less than 3 cm. The diameter of the handrails should not be more than 5 cm, and the maximum height should be 70–75 cm.

Classrooms consist of eight main components: lighting, thermal comfort, materials, colors, space distribution and circulation paths, furniture properties, space and aperture definition, and teaching techniques. Each component has a set of criteria that must be met to support the needs of patients with MS. The total number of qualitative and quantitative criteria for the design of classrooms is twenty-eight. The results of the statistical analysis show that 90 percent of students with MS were dissatisfied with the classrooms in their schools. The statistical analysis showed that 40 percent of the students who were not satisfied with the classrooms did not complete their education and withdrew from high school because the classrooms were not suitable for their sensory and mobility needs. The results were statistically significant (Chi-square = 12.57), which confirms that classroom design should be a key element in any design criteria for educational buildings used by students with MS. The satisfaction of the subjects with the eight components of the classrooms varied. The results show that there are significant design barriers, primarily in thermal comfort (90% dissatisfaction), furniture properties (85% dissatisfaction), space distribution and circulation paths (75% dissatisfaction), used materials (60% dissatisfaction), lighting (55% dissatisfaction), space and aperture definition (50% dissatisfaction), and teaching techniques (30% dissatisfaction). There were no design obstacles related to colors, the suitability of the type of artificial lighting used, or the suitability of the material of the desktop, as 95% of the students were satisfied with these components. In addition, 90 percent were satisfied with the dimensions of the doors and windows. Accordingly, the impact of each criterion on students with MS was reached and ranked by importance. This was accomplished by correlating each criterion statistical analysis in the second section of the survey with the reasons for dissatisfaction with the classrooms in the third section, as shown in Table 8.

Bathrooms have ten qualitative and quantitative criteria that need to be met to support the needs of students with MS. Bathrooms are some of the most important spaces of the educational built environment for these students because one of the common symptoms of MS is inflammation of the bladder and urinary incontinence, which leads to frequent visits to the bathroom. The results of the statistical analysis show that 80 percent of the students with MS were dissatisfied with the bathrooms in their schools. The statistical analysis showed that 88 percent of the students who were not satisfied with the bathrooms did not complete their education and withdrew from high school because the bathrooms were not suitable for their sensory and mobility needs. The results were statistically significant (Chi-square = 23.54), which confirms that bathroom design should be a key element in any design criteria for educational buildings used by students with MS. The satisfaction with the bathroom components varied. The results show that there are significant design barriers in the bathroom location (80% dissatisfaction), the layout and dimensions of the special needs unit in bathrooms (77% dissatisfaction), the sinks (65% dissatisfaction), the handrails attached to the walls (60% dissatisfaction), and the flooring (55% dissatisfaction). There were no design obstacles related to toilet colors or dimensions, as 95 percent of the students were satisfied with these design elements. Accordingly, the impact of each criterion on students with MS was reached and ranked by importance. This was accomplished by correlating each criterion statistical analysis in the second section of the survey with the reasons for dissatisfaction with the bathrooms in the third section, as shown in Table 9. The open-ended question revealed two additional criteria for bathroom design: Avoid lintels or different levels in front of the main bathroom door and the toilet units to prevent water from leaking out. Instead, control the slope of the ground to drain water. In addition, doors should open in both directions. The handrails attached to the walls next to the toilet should cover three sides and not just two. The third side (in front of the user) should also be movable, as needed.

Similar to previous studies that have highlighted disorders common to students with MS (Carter 2011), the results of this questionnaire show that there are signi cant sensory barriers, from dissatisfaction with thermal comfort to dissatisfaction with lighting. The mobility barriers stressed by Helm et al. (2016) and Young, Parikh, and Layne (2020) were clear in the results of the statistical analysis, which showed that students with MS are largely dissatisfied with the main entrance and the V&H circulation in their schools. The proposed DG-MS is comprehensive and holistic, and includes guidelines mentioned in existing literature and guidelines developed based the results of this study. It includes criteria that must be observed in the educational built environment that are essential to ensure that the educational buildings meet the needs of and are efficient and suitable for students with MS. This includes quantitative criteria related to the dimensions of architectural and design elements and qualitative criteria related to the materials and colors used. The importance of these elements and criteria were examined, and a final version of the DG-MS was developed that can be utilized in the design of new schools. The study may have had some limitations because it relied on user feedback more than field architectural or design-based evaluation of the participants' schools. However, we believe that this study will be of interest to future research because, through a thorough literature review and original research, results were obtained that identify ways in which educational built environments do not meet the needs of students with MS. Further, a comprehensive list of design criteria was created to meet these needs. Further studies should utilize the DG-MS to develop a design-based performance assessment tool to assess the suitability of any educational built environment for students with MS. Further studies are also needed to rank the importance of the design criteria so that priority can be given to the most important criteria when upgrading or designing a school. In addition, these criteria are not separated from the importance of their presence within Universal Design but were developed according to the specific details of the nature of the dimensions that people with MS need to address their sensory and mobility needs. This may be a topic that future research could focus on, that is, the similarities and differences between the Universal Design standards in the educational environment for people with special needs and the necessary standards for people with MS regarding lighting, materials, and dimensions. Further, we believe that this study makes a significant contribution to the literature because while various studies have identified important design guidelines to ensure that buildings are suitable for students with MS, there is no comprehensive, validated list of design elements that can be used in updating existing schools and for the design of new schools.

The International Journal of Design in Society is one of five thematically focused journals in the family of journals that support the Design Principles and Practices Research Network—its journals, book imprint, conference, and online community. It is a section of Design Principles and Practices: An International Journal. The International Journal of Design in Society interrogates the social sources and social effects of design. Focal points of interest include design policy, the human impacts of design, design values, and design as business. As well as papers of a traditional scholarly type, this journal invites case studies that take the form of presentations of practice—including documentation of socially-engaged design practices and exegeses analyzing the effects of those practices. The International Journal of Design in Society is a peer-reviewed, scholarly journal. ISSN 2325-1328
