Property Management Mobility Challenges and Experiences for Students with Disabilities in Tanzania Universities: Dealing with a Social Inclusion Nightmare in Property Management Journal: Property Management Manuscript ID PM-09-2021-0068 Manuscript Type: Research Paper Keywords: Buildings, Facilities, Property management, institutional buildings, Disability 3 Mobility Challenges and Experiences for Students with Disabilities in Tanzania 4 5 Universities: Dealing with a Social Inclusion Nightmare in Property Management 6 7 8 9 Abstract 11 Purpose 12 13 Despite the presence of people with disabilities in higher learning institutions, facilities 14 15 provided for both accommodation and classrooms prove to be ineffective in fulfilling their 16 expectations. However, the existing measures have tended to be rigid and unable to incorporate 18 the ever evolving user experiences from constantly enrolling students in public campus 19 20 buildings. The paper is premised on the notion of social inclusivity of the built environment in 21 22 public universities through user experiences, measured through a qualitative lens. 23 24 Methodology 25 26 The study was qualitative and deployed a case study strategy. Respondents were purposively 27 28 identified and subjected to in-depth interviews, key informant interviews and focused group 29 30 discussions. Full realisation of the sample frames determined by data saturation. Data from 31 responses was thereafter sorted, coded and categorised through a systematic thematic analysis. 33 Some responses were reported verbatim. Anonymity of the respondents was observed though 34 35 use of pseudonyms 36 37 Findings 38 39 This paper has indicated respondents' experiences regarding social inclusivity of the 41 institutional built environment and thematically categorised them in six areas, namely; 42 43 complaints mechanism and feedback, pre and post enrolment experiences and social support 44 as a property management policy. Others include, representation in university decision making 46 organs, perceptions regarding disability and its needs and distribution of facilities and site 47 48 works. It recommends that property management practices should be re-oriented to ensure 49 50 sustainability of learning facilities for disabled, taking into consideration the ever evolving 51 needs and preferences of PWD user students. 53 54 Originality 55 Linking the social and human rights models to actual experiences of property occupiers is 57 unique. It is the author's belief that it will, in addition to the existing models and strategies 58 59 3 improve on a better achievement of inclusivity of building use by all categories of members of 4 5 the society. 6 7 Key words: PWD students; social model; disability inclusion; university property management 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1. Introduction 16 Public institutional buildings are required to be accessible for all users including persons with 17 18 disabilities. That is to say, for a building to be sustainable and effective in terms of 19 20 performance, it should provide equal services to all users irrespective of their ability or 21 disability status (Soyingbe et al., 2007, Ravassard, 2018). International standards for accessible 23 built environment are used to refer to measure whether available facilities in higher learning 24 25 institutions conform or otherwise to the needs and expectations of people with disabilities 26 27 (PWDs) (Atkins and Brooks, 2015).This further guides vital actors and decision makers within 28 institutions especially property managers in appreciating the extent of usability of the buildings 29 30 they manage and on how to increase functionality and general inclusivity to the use by variety 31 32 of users. 33 34 International human rights and policies are in consensus that among others, PWDs have rights 35 36 to attend higher education just like those who are not disabled(Gayle-Geddes, 2015, Biegon, 37 38 2011, United Nations, 1949). Historically, people with disabilities were perceived as a socio- 39 economically disadvantaged group thus they were excluded from many economic and social 40 41 benefits by the society, such as education (Mutasa et al., 2013). Later, McLeod et al. (2014) 42 43 established that students with physical disabilities experience limitations in school 44 environments in such ways that affect their social life, psychological and academic spheres. 46 Mutasa et al (2013) and Ravassard (2018) expound further that, despite the low numbers of 47 48 PWD students in higher education, on paper, more efforts are geared towards creation of 49 50 inclusive education access. Inclusive education offers equal opportunities for all people within 51 the society to develop their skills for their well-being. 53 54 Opportunities for PWDs to access institutional and other related accommodation facilities at 55 higher education institutions is provoked by the growing international interest in supporting 57 their learning (Healey et al., 2006). This is inspired by numerous legislations such as Americans 58 59 with Disability Act of 1990 in United States, Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act of 3 1992 in Australia and Disability Discrimination Acts of 1995 and 2005 in the United 4 5 Kingdom(Adams, 2002). All these legislations place special emphasis on equitable education 6 7 for all citizens including PWDs. 8 9 Ormerod and Newton (2005) correctly observe that, accessibility of built environment in higher 10 11 learning institutions is a critical consideration for enhancement of a socially inclusive society. 12 However, one of the challenges faced by PWDs in public tertiary institutions, especially in 14 Africa, is physical access within the university campus environment (Mutanga, 2017, Uromi 15 16 and Mazagwa, 2014, Soyingbe et al., 2007). Given such exclusion, there is occasionally a 17 18 feeling of a society-orchestrated discrimination of PWD students and hence erosion of 19 opportunities for integration(Okolie, 2011). 21 22 Investigating inclusivity in the public institutional property management is a continuing 23 concern within the built environment arena. A study undertaken by Kavishe and Isibika (2018) 25 from the Ardhi University- Tanzania investigated and provided useful insights regarding the 26 27 access to library services by users in wheelchairs. Presently, scanty information is available on 28 29 the experiences that public institutional property users encounter especially PWDs regarding 30 effectiveness of provided facilities and their fitness for purpose, especially in a developing 32 country like Tanzania. However, much needs to be investigated regarding the compliance of 33 34 available facilities―beyond just library services, amidst a general inclusivity debate. Public 35 36 university built facilities include; hostel accommodation, lecture spaces, offices, walkways and 37 other related facilities. The experiences obtained will provide the extent of social inclusion in 38 39 the access to and usability of built facilities of public higher learning institutions for PWDs. 40 41 Additionally, this will help to determine the influence of the social disability model in 42 enhancing an understanding on how PWD students in public universities in Tanzania are 44 socially embraced judging by the compliance of the built available buildings to their needs. 45 46 47 The next sections embark on literature review and conceptualisation of PWDs and their access 48 to public institutional buildings, theorisation of the social and human rights models of 50 disability. Thereafter, the methods adopted in this paper are discussed, findings, discussion and 51 52 lastly conclusion and recommendations. 53 54 2. Literature Review 55 56 A considerable amount of literature has been published on the significance of PWDs' access 57 58 to educational facilities. These studies emphasise that, PWD students deserve to access higher 59 education as those who are not disabled(Reyes, 2014, Dispenza, 2019, Bhattacharya, 2010). 3 Higher education is of much importance for all individuals as it helps them to achieve personal 4 5 objectives, prove worthiness of a person and meet family expectations, enhance success in 6 7 workplace as well as increase financial security through employment(Fullarton and Duquette, 8 2016). In the past, PWDs were exposed to limited access to education especially in sub Saharan 10 Africa due to structural and social bottlenecks and negative societal stereotypes(Oyaro, 2015). 11 12 Similarly, Barnes (1991) and Field et al. (2003) aver that, for long PWDs have been subjected 13 to discrimination in education as could largely not access enrolment openings; shortly they 15 were considered as unimportant group within the society 16 17 18 Societal exclusion of PWD students has been a long standing challenge. On many occasions, 19 as Vickerman and Blundell (2010) and Riddell et al. (2005) indicate, students with certain 21 biological and physical characteristics have been excluded from accessing higher education 22 23 with the assumption that tertiary institutions were not placed for disabled persons. However 24 25 recently, access to higher education for marginalized groups PWDs has gained international 26 attention. The UN for instance, has made steps geared towards inclusivity of PWDs in societies. 27 28 These have been operationalised through; the standard rules on equalisation of opportunities 29 30 for PWDs―introduced in 1994, in addition to the convention on the rights of PWDs adopted 31 in 2006. This implies that, for countries which are signatory to these conventions, it is 33 incumbent on them to advocate as much as possible, the inclusivity of PWDs, especially 34 35 regarding their access to the built environment. Eventually, this is to be upheld as a right 36 37 through local laws and regulations. Debates with regard to access to higher education 38 institutions for minority groups particularly PWDs are largely centred on equality and tension 40 (Phasha and Mosia, 2017). 41 42 According to UN Department of economic and Social Affairs-UNDESA (2015), the fourth 44 Sustainable Development Goal aims to build and upgrade educational facilities such that 45 46 children, disability and gender sensitive groups obtain safe, non-violent, effective and inclusive 47 48 learning environments for all. Studies indicate that higher educational institutions have 49 recognized the importance of inclusive education thus encourage students with physical 51 disabilities to take part in education by providing them with special facilities(Riddell et al., 52 53 2005, Sanjeev and Kumar, 2007). 54 55 The study by Majoko (2018) in Zimbabwe reveals that with the passage of Education Act in 56 57 2006 and Disabled Act, increasing PWD students have gained access to educational services 58 59 since these regulations safeguard equity and equality to educational opportunities to a 3 considerable degree. However, the study identified some barriers towards full participation for 4 5 PWD students in higher learning institutions like; failure of lecturers to meet needs of disabled 6 7 students and some non-inclusive lecture sessions and general academic environment which 8 were generally attributed to inadequate orientation of the lectures on how best to handle PWDs. 10 Additionally, Jameel (2011) conducted a study on disability in the context of higher education 11 12 in India. It was revealed that access to higher educational institutions by PWDs is generally 13 promoted, and they follow same procedures of application as students without disabilities. 15 Furthermore, the study highlighted major obstacle for disabled students to complete their 16 17 studies in higher education which is physical access. 18 19 This current paper asserts however that, in addition to assessing inclusivity vis a vis the 21 academic environment by PWDs and the barriers faced, there is a need to conduct an in-depth 22 23 study using the qualitative approach to assess the experiences disabled students encounter in 24 25 their interaction with the built environment. The fact is supported by a number of previous 26 scholars (Jameel, 2011, Majoko, 2018, Sanjeev and Kumar, 2007), Furthermore, it is important 27 28 to elucidate how the tenets of the social and human rights disability models help informing 29 30 inclusivity of the users of the built environment through the experiences shared. 31 32 Disability and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) 33 34 Disability is regarded as inability of an individual to engage fully in society's activities due to 36 mental social or physical factors. Ward (1979) refers to it as an impairment that takes away 37 38 abilities that otherwise the culprit could have enjoyed. whereas, the disability condition can be 39 40 temporary or permanent (Retief and Letšosa, 2018), all human beings at some points of their 41 lives are exposed to disability conditions. If it happens that one survives the impairment then 43 aging shall make them disabled in a way or another (Olkin, 2001, Murtagh and Hubert, 2004), 44 45 though such trends are not linear for all (Christensen et al., 2008, Cutler, 2001). Inferably, 46 47 PWDs face various difficulties and socially influenced vulnerabilities that at times limit them 48 from successfully engaging in social activities like education. Disabled people include those 50 with permanent disabilities like confinement to a wheelchair, limited walking mobility, 51 52 visually impaired persons, deaf, down syndromes and temporary disabilities like persons with 53 pregnancy, broken limbs, stained muscles and old age (Charlton, 1998, Soyingbe et al., 2007). 55 56 There is a wide debate about appreciation of the term disability as in the past, it was viewed 57 58 largely from medical perspectives (Jameel, 2011, Darcy and Buhalis, 2010). In today's world, 59 the understanding of disability extended to be viewed within human rights lenses (Degener, 3 2016). Accordingly, disability is increasingly ceasing to be interpreted as handicap or 4 5 permanent physical impairments. Reynolds and Fletcher-Janzen (2007) describe it as a 6 7 condition resulting from several causes like accident, trauma, genetics or disease that limit a 8 person's mobility, hearing, vision and mental functioning. 10 11 About 15% of the world population has some forms of disabilities, which make them 12 challenged in functioning (WHO, 2013) and 80% of these live in developing countries (Uromi 14 and Mazagwa, 2014, WHO, 2003, WHO, 2013). Of these, Sri lanka and South Africa each 15 16 estimates at 5% (Keerthirathna et al., 2010, Losinsky et al., 2003). This group is termed as 17 18 world's largest minority, and it is among the least educated citizens (Groce et al., 2011). For 19 Tanzania's case, the national disability survey conducted in 2008 estimated that 13.2% of the 21 country's total population is affected some forms of disabilities (Sida, 2014), an increase from 22 23 an ealier one by (ILO, 2009) which estimated at 9% of the country's population. 24 25 Accessibility to public buildings for PWDs 26 27 28 The rights to access public buildings, especially institutional ones is currently gaining credence 29 as a human right. There is therefore an increasing desire for assessing buildings compliance 31 and inclusiveness towards student PWDs (Lau et al., 2016, Keerthirathna et al., 2010), 32 33 especially for public institutional buildings. Importantly, there are two main perspectives to be 34 taken into consideration to aid adequate appreciation of this phenomenon; access to and 36 accessibility to the built environment. As Maidin (2012) asserts, access to the built environment 37 38 is concerned with possibility of all users reach all sections of the built environment. 39 40 Accessibility on the other hand is more concerned with independence while using the built 41 environment (Maidin, 2012, Hamzat and Dada, 2005). That is to say all public buildings 43 including educational buildings should offer opportunities for all people to manoeuver without 44 45 obstructions by implementing the so-called barrier free designs (Keerthirathna et al., 2010). 46 47 Accessibility entails how people get to various areas like classrooms, hostels, administration 48 49 blocks and libraries around campus environment. Furthermore, in tandem with 50 51 manoeuvrability, it covers aspects of time and distance travelled by PWDs within the campus. 52 Losinsky et al. (2003) argue that inaccessibility of buildings and associated facilities limit full 54 integration of PWDs into campus life. This effectively implies that, the significance of 55 56 accessible and inclusive public institutional buildings including the social environment within 57 58 which they are should not be overlooked for social sustainability (Lau et al., 2016) to be 59 achieved. Accessible buildings and learning facilities within campuses encourage students with 3 disabilities to complete higher education. Unfortunately, as Toutain (2019) indicates, there are 4 5 several bottlenecks that prevent PWDs from completing their education successfully, 6 7 significant of which being inaccessible learning environment. Furthermore, there are other 8 barriers which make the built environment especially in higher learning institutions 10 inaccessible. These include; lack of dropped kerbs, steep gradient on ramps, rough and slippery 11 12 surfaces, narrow pavements, lack of handrails on ramps, lack of resting places or landings on 13 stairs and ramps as well as poor maintenance of facilities for disabled people (Baris and Uslu, 15 2009). Such barriers impede movements into university built environment and therefore restrict 16 17 PWDs to partake educational activities unabated. 18 19 This is to say, all important building facilities particularly ramps, staircases, pathways or 21 walkways, corridors, doors, entrances and the like should be designed in a way that enhances 22 23 usability by all in an independent way (Osman et al., 2015). Since there is connection between 24 25 student performance and accessibility (Xu et al., 2020, Cheryan et al., 2014, Jameel, 2011), it 26 is the task of the society to ensure that all buildings around campuses are accessible. 27 28 Advantages of accessible and inclusive built environment cannot be confined to PWDs only. 29 30 In real sense, accessibility covers wide range of users including; elders, pregnant women, 31 persons carrying heavy burdens, people with broken legs among others (Steinfeld and Maisel, 33 2012) . It is therefore emphasized that accessible public buildings that include educational 34 35 buildings is a critical factor for obtaining an inclusive society (Ormerod and Newton, 2005). 36 37 Education access and PWDs in Tanzanian 38 39 40 In Tanzania, inclusivity of education has got much attention in recent years. It is guided by 41 legislation and policy specifically Persons with Disability Act of 2010 and Tanzania's National 43 Policy on Disability of 2004. Section 27(1) of the Act states that persons with disability in all 44 45 ages and gender have the same rights to education. Section 29 of the Act provides that, special 46 47 facilities are required to ensure quality education to persons with disability. Furthermore, 48 section 35(1) states that "the minister shall in consultation with the minister responsible for 50 buildings and as far as practicable, ensure that every public building and other buildings which 51 52 provide services publicly are accessible to all persons with disabilities." However, the available 53 legislation is devoid of the minimum facilities that have to be provided for, to fit within 55 minimum standards of the usability of disabled users of institutional facilities, especially 56 57 institutions of higher learning. Furthermore, enforcement mechanisms are vague in cases of 58 59 non-compliance, in addition to failure in constant evaluation of experiences and needs of the 3 actual concerned users of the inclusive facilities. This if done, would help guide relevant policy 4 5 and practice for the effective property management of the institutional buildings. 6 7 From the foregoing review, it is admissible that much literature has examined disability and 8 9 physical accessibility to buildings, some of which to institutional buildings(Keerthirathna et 10 11 al., 2010, Kavishe and Isibika, 2018, Hamzat and Dada, 2005, Losinsky et al., 2003). Others 12 have proposed the tools or measures that can help to assess inclusivity of buildings. However, 14 such measures have tended to be rigid and unable to incorporate the ever evolving user 15 16 experiences from constantly enrolling students in public campus buildings. There is limited 17 18 research to date, that qualitatively digs deep into the experiences of such users to guide property 19 management and PWD inclusion. Furthermore, no studies were identified by the researcher 21 that qualitatively linked students' experiences with the social inclusion of the built environment 22 23 at public university campuses, especially hinging on the social and human rights models. 24 25 3. Conceptualising disability-mingling social and human rights models 26 27 Social model 28 29 The social disability model was developed in the 1970s by activists in the Union of the 31 Physically Impaired Against Segregation stemming from the Fundamental Principles of 32 33 Disability document (UPIAS, 1976, Shakespeare, 2006). Based on this model, disability is the 34 socially constructed phenomenon where social conditions in a certain society may create 36 disability (Retief and Letšosa, 2018, Oliver, 2013). Social model of disability posits that, it is 37 38 the society which disables people with impairment implying that attitudes, perceptions and 39 40 structures of the society defines disability (Goering, 2015). Furthermore, proponents of this 41 model locate the problem of disability outside individuals leading to existence of 43 discrimination policies (Degener, 2016). Shakespeare (2006) further emphasises that, the social 44 45 model shifts the blame away from disabled people to the society (societal responsibility for the 46 47 wellbeing of the disabled). This implies that, it is the society which disables people through 48 attitudes, perceptions and structures within which they operate. Thus, any meaningful actions 50 should be directed at societal changes rather than individual adjustments and rehabilitation 51 52 (Hughes, 2010). 53 54 The social model of disability has contributed greatly to differentiation between disability and 55 56 impairment. Soyingbe et al. (2007) and Dagenham (2001) argue that, this the disadvantage or 57 58 restriction of the activity caused by a contemporary social organization which takes little or no 59 account of people who have physical impairments and thus excludes them from participation 3 in the mainstream of routine social activity. Therefore, some proponents take disability as a 4 5 form of social oppression (Oliver, 2004). Alternatively, impairment refers to lacking part or all 6 7 of the limb or having defective limb, organ or mechanism of the body (Oliver, 2004). No matter 8 their physical shortfalls, the relevance of this model elaborates the dynamics through which 10 disabled people can access the same built environment services which the physically enabled 11 12 can access. 13 14 However, the social disability model has faced some criticism as follows; it differentiates 15 16 between disability and impairment implying that the model ignores subjective pain of both 17 18 impairment and disability, the social model merely explains disability as it does not encompass 19 important aspects like values for disability policy which acknowledge dignity of people with 21 disabilities and does not seek moral principles as foundation for disability policy (Degener, 22 23 2016). Additionally, the social model of disability is the center of rights-based approach to 24 25 disability which focuses much on anti-discrimination law rather than on welfare programs 26 (Goering, 2015). Also, the social model of disability is unable to deal adequately with realities 27 28 of impairments, it is unable to incorporate other social divisions like race, gender, aging and 29 30 sexuality hence it proves to be an inadequate model of disablement (Oliver, 2004). However, 31 as Oliver (2013) indicates, much as it is understandably not an all-encompassing framework, 33 the model has potential to improve the lives of disabled people. The model is also important in 34 35 this study in that, it guides explanations as to how the societal perception of institutional 36 37 buildings users' disabilities affect inclusivity of PWDs in their access to university built 38 facilities. 40 41 Human right model 42 43 Disability has become human right and developmental issues (Oduro, 2009). This model puts 44 45 much emphasis on how people value each other within the society regardless disability. 46 47 According to Degener (2016), human right model focuses on inherent dignity of human being 48 and if necessary, on person's medical characteristics, which places individual center stage in 50 all decisions affecting an individual and locates the problem outside the person as well as 51 52 society. This model is characterized by; acknowledging identity issues, valuing impairment as 53 part of human diversity, give explanation that impairment does not hinder human rights 55 capacity, allows for assessment of policy and striving for moral justice (Degener, 2014). 56 57 58 In the course of addressing disability as a human rights concern, United Nations through 59 Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right for all societal members to access 3 education at various levels without discrimination (Tudzi et al., 2017). Through UN CRDP, 4 5 there is a paradigm shift from seeing disability as social or medical matter towards realizing 6 7 that disability is a human right that in one way or another results to meet developmental goals 8 to a person hence global developmental goal (Hayes and Bulat, 2020). 10 11 4. Case Study Area 12 The study focused on Ardhi University (ARU) and University of Dar es salaam (UDSM), two 14 public universities in the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. UDSM is the largest and oldest 15 16 public university in Tanzania. It is located on the 13 km Western side of Dar es Salaam region, 17 18 and occupies about 1625acres of the observational hill. It has several campuses within and 19 outside the region, four schools, seven colleges and five institutes (UDSM, 2020). By the time 21 the study was conducted, there were around 27,000 students pursuing their studies of which 22 23 152 students possess differing types of disabilities (office of dean of students) 24 25 ARU on the other hand is located in Kinondoni municipal council, about 12km from Dar es 26 27 Salaam city centre. It is situated on observation hill alongside the university road and it is 28 29 bordered by the UDSM main campus. It has six schools and one institute which accommodate 30 5000 students, and according to the office of dean of students, about 10 possess various 32 disabilities (mobility, hearing and eyesight). The selected cases also provided insight on 33 34 reasons for differential services among higher learning institutions despite being run by the 35 36 government and management practices that ensure inclusivity of built facilities for people 37 living with disabilities. 38 39 40 5. Methods and sampling 41 This study was a qualitative one, taking a form of a case study of PWD students and their 43 experiences. This was important to enable an in-depth understanding (Creswell and Creswell, 44 45 2017, Kothari, 2019) of the extent of social inclusion of the disabled users of the institutional 46 47 built environment. Respondents were purposively identified, focusing on the relevance for the 48 issue at hand (Goundar, 2013) though with particular categorisation. For each campus, 50 selection of the key informants included; students' guild leaders (03), estates office staff (02), 51 52 Department of Accommodation Services (01) and hall of residence wardens (03). For the 53 UDSM campus, 30 students (20 of whom disabled) and 15 students (05 of whom disabled) for 55 ARU campus were subjected to in-depth interviews. For each of the two campuses, 06 56 57 participants were carefully selected for engagement in a focus group discussion, being mindful 58 59 of variety of perspectives, disability exposure, charged responsibilities and length of stay in the 3 university. Full realisation of the sample frames was determined by data saturation/redundancy 4 (Patton, 2002, Maxwell, 2013). The principle of data saturation, majorly employed in 6 7 qualitative research, posits that when undertaking interviews, a researcher only stops at a point 8 when no new data can be obtained from respondents (Fusch and Ness, 2015, Saunders et al., 10 2018). Hence, responses having reached a point of data saturation. 11 12 The key selected areas include lecture rooms, administration offices, libraries, student hostels, 14 cafeterias and general walkways as basis for observation (Table 1). The selected built facilities 15 16 were on the basis of common use by students. In addition to walkways, in total, selection 17 18 included, thirty buildings from ARU and UDSM were chosen. The data from responses was 19 thereafter sorted, coded and categorised through a systematic thematic analysis. Some of the 21 responses were reported verbatim, to observe anonymity of the respondents, pseudonyms are 22 23 used throughout the paper (Table 2). 24 25 6. Findings 26 27 This section presents the findings obtained from the study that investigated the social 28 29 inclusivity of the built services for PWD students, using a case study of two public universities 30 in Tanzania. Experiences shared in this section exhibit the various ways through which 32 compliance to social disability and human rights models can significantly impact inclusivity in 33 34 usability of institutional facilities for PWD students. Key tenets guiding these experiences are 35 36 that; social structures, perceptions and attitudes not only create disability but exacerbate it. 37 Emphasising societal responsibility for the wellbeing of the disabled and human dignity being 38 39 at the centre of organisational decision making. These tenets have been key in guiding 40 41 explanations as to how societal perception of institutional buildings users' disabilities affect 42 inclusivity of students in their access to university buildings. 44 45 6.1. Complaints mechanisms and feedback 46 47 48 Inclusivity and visible participation are important in complaints handling regarding building 49 users perceived to be vulnerable like the PWDs. Regarding representation on the decision 51 making organs, participants considered it as key to responsiveness and social inclusivity. 52 53 However, in ordinary practice it was an exception rather than a norm as a respondent reported: 54 55 "Nowhere are PWD students represented, from student guild 57 committees up to the university's highest governing organs. At least 58 no policy stipulates that anywhere" 59 60 Student, interview, ARU, May 2021 3 Another hinted: 4 5 "The lag experienced in handling our disputes makes you assume that 7 either the responsible powers are unaware of the importance of our 8 concerns or they are simply ignored. In the end, our priorities get lost 9 in the general complaints handling" 11 Student, interview, UDSM, May 2021 13 14 the foregoing experiences reinforce the importance of prioritisation of human dignity and 15 diversity caused by disability when institutions are making vital decisions. Once adequate 17 representation onto the decision making organs is not seen to be done, perceptions of societal 18 19 irresponsibility for the needs of PWD students follow suit. Complaints handling and need for 20 21 involvement and participation for inclusive built facilities must begin at the point designs for 22 such infrastructure are being contemplated. Observations and participant interactions indicated 23 24 that PWD users are rarely considered during designing various buildings and infrastructure 25 26 around campuses. Eventually, only one block (3.33% of observed buildings) was noted for 27 instance possess special unisex disabled toilets. In other blocks PWD students had to adjust to 29 life of using toilets and bathrooms that are designed for abled users. This is in addition to floor 30 31 level changes between the ground and toilet, narrow doors especially in bathrooms and lack of 32 33 backseats for toilets. 34 35 Elevators 37 38 This paper is cognisant of the fact that the building code requires elevators for buildings beyond 39 40 four levels. In addition to twenty buildings (66.67%) possessing more than one floor (for which 41 ramps would suffice), even those for which lifts were a necessity were lacking. Results 43 indicated that only four buildings (20%) were equipped with special lifts for ensuring access 44 45 to any part of the building by people living with disabilities. Consequently, students and other 46 47 PWD building users are confined from accessing and operating effectively in some parts of 48 buildings around universities. 50 51 In highlighting this point, respondents M1, L3 and W1 from university U explained: 52 53 The built environment needs to be as inclusive as possible but variations 54 in provision of facilities comes directly from design team. If it fails to 55 consider the needs of PWDs compliant facilities, no implementation 57 will be done 58 59 Respondent M3 from university A highlighted this reason as design criteria 3 As for me the main reason for why you see that in some buildings with 4 change in levels there are accessible facilities and others without is due 5 to the design criteria. Contractors always work in accordance to what has been designed by architects. They have no abilities to construct a facility out of specifications from drawing. Therefore, variation of PWD facilities all over university's built environment has its source 10 from design errors. 11 12 The revelations above, implies that response to and the differing levels of compliance to 13 14 complaints raised by PWDs regarding the inclusivity of the built facilities provided are hardly 15 prioritised. This lack or scarcity of prioritisation seems to arise from the bureaucratic 17 tendencies where each party pushes responsibility of ensuring compliance of built facilities to 18 19 another. On the contrary, one of the tenets of the social disability theory is the need to take 20 responsibility in ensuring that social inclusion is achieved for PWDs. 22 23 6.2. Pre and post enrolment experiences 24 25 For the two university campuses, the study identified a clear identification process of PWDs at 27 the point of filling and processing of admission forms. A medical form stipulating a variety of 28 29 physical disabilities of the applicant is filled and checked at the university medical centres. 30 Some of the conditions for which statistical data was obtained include; eyesight possibility of 32 impairment, mobility challenges, and hearing impairments. Much as on paper the admission 33 34 requirements and the procedures that follow indicate social inclusion of PWDs some 35 36 respondents' experiences are contrary. A participant commented: 37 38 "..I applied here with my PWD friend who moves in a wheel chair but 39 who even performed better than me. But she was not admitted and I 40 was, moreover for the same program. She felt that this failure could 41 have been based on the disability status she declared on the 43 application forms" 44 45 Student, interview, ARU, May 2021 46 47 48 Another participant noted: 50 51 "After admission and enrolment, I expected to be given special 52 orientation by the Dean of Students or/and hall wardens regarding how 53 I will ensure mobility and access to buildings and other facilities on 54 campus. This would include; social assistance and provision of special 55 facilities and equipment. At the most, such assistance has only been 57 provided after insistent request and on a personal level" 58 59 Student, interview, UDSM, May 2021 60 3 4 5 In addition, the participant said: 6 7 "The only assurance from the university accommodation policy 8 is that the disabled are automatically accommodated in on- campus hostels. But the types of rooms and facilities therein aren't any special" 12 13 14 Such scenarios, partly explain the limited number of PWD students that are admitted in these 16 public universities. Even with the few that cut the mark, their inclusivity seems not to be 17 18 prioritised. In justification of the loop-sided prioritisation of property and other social services 19 20 provision, some key informants M1 and M3 alluded: 21 22 We don't have those facilities all over the campus because the 23 university enrols few numbers of PWD students compared to 24 those who are in normal condition. 26 Another, a students' leader added: 27 28 29 We onetime were forced to fundraise for a tricycle for one of our 30 PWD colleagues through fellow students. The Dean's Office just 31 came in to support when initiatives had been laid and already in 32 high gear. He had received no social support since enrolment 33 34 The above revelation testifies to the reactionary nature in which management of built facilities 35 in public institutions is held. It is important that sustainable planning strategies are emphasised, 37 budget provisions set up in advance of enrolments for social inclusivity to be ensured in the 38 39 use of built facilities at campuses. However, the government policy has recently had a paradigm 40 41 shift, a changing attitude towards PWDs as a participant indicates: 42 43 Recently the government of Tanzania insisted clearly on inclusive 44 education. To implement this all buildings that are constructed now 45 take into consideration the needs of users living with disabilities. 47 However, government policy has not yet trickled down to the ground. A key informant noted: 48 49 50 Much as statistical data is captured at the pre and enrolment stage, 51 limited follow up is done in liaison with the estates department to ensure 52 property use concerns addressed timely and adequately 53 54 Therefore, for social inclusivity to be attained, it need not be a one-occasion affair. It ought to 55 be an intentionally continuous practice, planned in for advance in the property management 57 and maintenance programs, not only going forward, but even retrospective repairs for existing 58 59 buildings that are devoid of services. The revelations have also indicated how social inclusion 3 is only pursued and at times provided at personal level, hence lacking a streamlined purposeful 4 5 institutional strategy that would make it sustainable. 6 7 8 9 10 6.3. Social support as property management policy 11 12 the study established that, the available social support initiatives through the Deans' and 13 14 Wardens' offices are largely vague. Students affairs at the two campuses are administered 15 through a students' handbook (largely guiding on the rules and regulations), and a gender 17 policy for gender related matters. A respondent indicated: 18 19 20 The university largely gives PWD affairs a lip service 21 Some of the PWD students expressed their expectations regarding social support from the 23 university as they indicated: 24 25 26 For colleagues with visual and hearing impairments, we expect the 27 university to employ and provide assistants and/or interpreters for 28 the assigned PWD student within and outside the lecture rooms 29 30 Provision of social support, especially in ensuring effective mobility on campus and access to 31 services i.e. administrative, academic and accommodation has to be prioritised and planned for 33 in advance. However, departments that are charged with such responsibility seem to relegate it 34 35 to the peripheral. justifying why they shun this vital segment of building users, those in charge 36 37 of property management and administrative affairs brand such effective social response as 38 costly as one respondent stated: 40 41 Inclusion becomes a cost that is un budgeted for by the officers 42 in charge of estates 43 44 Another re-emphasised: 45 46 "…it is good to have accessible environment around campus in 47 such a way that the disabled can reach anywhere with little or 48 no assistance. But expenses and budgetary constraints hinder the 49 changes. Some facilities specifically lifts are expensive to install 51 and maintain". 52 Key informant, ARU, June 2021 54 55 The preceding revelations are indicative of the tendencies in public institutions where design 56 57 and construction of institutional buildings is done without consultation but with little focus on 58 the social requirements of the prospective users. This is irrespective of the users' levels and/or 60 type of perceived disability. It is rather vital, for the institutional communities to take 3 responsibility for the well-being of the disabled students as users of campus buildings, 4 5 irrespective of the cost implications such compliance would lead to. 6 7 8 9 10 6.4. Representation on decision making organs 11 12 Perception of equity in the use of built environment services and a sense of social inclusion, 13 14 gains much meaning if minority groups especially PWDs are represented on the decision 15 making organs. For several respondents however, they perceived representation and 17 involvement to be below par. A respondent indicated: 18 19 20 we don't have a PWD representative on the guild council or even 21 the senate and council. I am not surprised that our requirements 22 when raised are not delivered in time and when needed most 23 24 A student leader noted: 25 26 there are cases of hearing and partial eyesight impairment for 27 instance that go unreported to the campus leadership 29 Non representation creates a perception of social exclusion. This could largely explain why 30 31 PWDs occasionally resort to alternative ways of exploiting their effective use of the campus 32 33 built facilities, disregarding the structures set by the campus administrations. 34 35 6.5. Perceptions regarding disability and its needs 36 37 The social disability model emphasises that disability is a perception, either by the affected 39 party or by the social environment in which a PWD operates. Such perceptions in a way impact 40 41 how PWDs interact with the built environment of the selected public institutions. For instance, 42 for some respondents, perceptions resulted in provision of differential disabled facilities. A 44 respondent W explained 45 46 47 …we have normal toilets here and rooms to accommodate people living 48 with disabilities are just normal. It is taken that disabled students shall 49 with time adopt the circumstances… 50 51 Another respondent(M1) stated: 52 53 ...sometimes there is a need for provision of disabled facilities like 54 accessible ramp but the institution only provides if there arise a need from 55 users 57 These responses indicate that variations in perceptions among different members who are 58 59 directly involved in management of disabled facilities in the selected campuses is among 3 factors which results in provision of not only differential but non inclusive services. Some, 4 5 after installation of PWD user facilities, there are no efforts taken to technically orient the 6 7 targeted users on their effective use. A key informant however said: 8 9 …most of disabled facilities have their own maintenance manual. The 10 problem here is we do not follow what the manual tells us, we don't even 11 train it to the users. Additionally, the organization itself has no schedule to 13 14 Impliedly, because of the care free focus by those in charge of facilities installation, servicing 15 16 and management to orient and train their effective use to the targeted PWD users, there is a risk 17 18 of facilities mismanagement. Eventually, the facilities break down even before they have 19 served their intended life cycle. As the experiences indicate, this is primarily anchored in the 21 unfocused perceptions regarding the needs and requirements of PWD users of the public 22 23 campus facilities. Such perception eventually focus of the facility management practice not be 24 25 socially inclusive regarding the expectations of the PWDs. 26 27 In addition, there were cases noted among participants where they who do not wish to be 28 29 regarded as PWDs. Explaining this perception, a respondent said: 30 31 Much as one of my legs is lame and my mobility is with support, 32 I take it as an offence to be regarded as a PWD. What other 33 people can do I can too. Somehow I can access most of the 35 rooms on campus so taking me as PWD would be seggregative. 36 However, such attitude could be disadvantageous to others who may need more special social 38 assistance for effective use of the institutional built facilities. 39 40 6.6. Distribution of facilities and site works 42 43 Findings indicate that, out of thirty observed buildings for both campuses, twenty have more 44 45 than one floor and the remaining ten buildings exactly have one floor. Categorization of 46 47 observed buildings on basis of number of floors is illustrated in Table 2. 48 49 Ramps, staircases, disabled toilets, stairs, corridors, car parks, signage installation, lifts and 50 51 walkways were observed and then reactions from users were sought regarding their effective 52 53 performance. A respondent stated: 54 55 Ideally, all entrances should be accessible to disabled users so 56 as to allow them to get into the building and operate freely. 57 58 Findings show that there was variation of levels between pathways and building entrances. 59 60 Only two buildings (6.67%) were observed to be accessible without ramps. However out of the 3 remaining twenty eighty (93.33%) buildings, twelve of them could be accessed through ramps. 4 5 This implies that more than half of observed buildings were not accessible for PWDs 6 7 specifically wheelchair users and those who are visually impaired. Entrances were not 8 accessible and exclude physically challenged people as they were equipped with steps without 10 provision of alternative means to enable people with disabilities to freely access. Out of thirty 11 observed buildings twenty-nine (96.67%) had staircases mainly straight stairs, quarter turn and 13 spiral stairs (Plate 1). Experiences regarding performance of these were connected to; narrow 15 tread, steeper-than-required ramps and variations in levels of landing. A respondent reacted: 16 17 18 such inefficiencies cause us to get unnecessary accidents, we 19 occasionally fall, get embarrassed and eventually feel out of place 20 21 furthermore, despite the fact that pathways were well connected from passenger loading zones 22 as per building benchmarking requirements, 75% of observed pathways were not accessible to 24 wheelchair users. This is because they were equipped by steps thus make it difficult for mobility 25 26 of PWDs without extra support (see Plate.3). The use of disabled signages is largely 27 overlooked. This is because only 16.67% of studied buildings have signs, and the conformance 29 of observed signs to accessible standards. 30 31 32 The provision of various PWD compliant facilities especially for ARU campus was intended 33 for limited access. For instance, a respondent indicated: 35 36 Ramps that are provided on each of these buildings stop at just the 37 ground floor (Plate 2). It is as if the design implementers never expect 38 PWDs to access other floors of the buildings. It becomes a nightmare 39 when the lecture and exam timetable is drafted. It assumes you can 40 access everywhere, as sessions are distributed at several floors 41 knowing that access thereon is limited 43 The experiences exhibited herein indicate that, because of scarce social inclusion, many 45 provided building and student social services seem misdirected against what actually PWDs 46 47 wish to be addressed. Most of the available provisions are largely designed for users with 48 immobile limbs, leaving requirements of the other types of impairments unaddressed. The 50 omission of other types of disabilities could either be attributed to societal ignorance or 51 52 reluctance. The subsequent complaints that arise resulting from this deficit either take time to 53 54 handle or arbitrarily addressed after complaints have been raised. 55 56 7. Discussion 57 58 The cardinal intention of this paper was to assess the extent of social inclusion in the access 59 and usability of built facilities of public higher learning institutions for PWDs. This study has 3 been guided by both the social disability model and the human rights model of disability to 4 5 ensure an in-depth appreciation of the phenomenon at hand. The social model illustrates 6 7 disability as a socially constructed phenomenon where several social conditions in a given 8 society may create disability through attitudes, perceptions and structures of the society within 10 which PWDs live. The human rights model on the other hand, emphasises how people value 11 12 each other within the society regardless of disability―embracing and learning to live with 13 diversity. In this way, accessing educational facilities as a human right for all societal members 15 is emphasised as part of the universal declaration of human rights (United Nations, 1949). 16 17 18 This paper has indicated the respondents' experiences regarding social inclusivity of the 19 institutional built environment and thematically categorised them in six areas. These include; 21 complaints mechanism and feedback, pre and post enrolment experiences and social support 22 23 as a property management policy. Others include, representation on university decision making 24 25 organs, perceptions regarding disability and its needs and distribution of facilities and site 26 works. 27 28 29 Generally, buildings are designed to meet specific purposes say retail, offices, industrial and 30 institutional. for universities, buildings are designed to utilise the available facilities as tools 32 for transmitting knowledge and promotion of learning to users (Okolie, 2011). Since 33 34 accessibility for PWDs is a global concern particularly for educational facilities, relevant 35 36 standards should be pursued that ensure social inclusion in management and use of the built 37 facilities (Bates and Davis, 2004, Jolley et al., 2018). Additionally, realignments should be 38 39 done to existing facilities in a bid to enhance more accessible mobility. By doing so, the campus 40 41 environment can be barrier free thereby promoting inclusive access, mobility and use therein. 42 43 This paper has emphasised that, a clear and transparent complaints handling mechanism and 44 45 representation on various campus decision making organs are key in ensuring social inclusivity 46 47 of PWDs. Complaints resolution could be vital even in persuading appropriate realignment of 48 non-compliant institutional property management practices and built environment functions 50 (Shafie et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2019). The tendency of taking unnecessarily long for 51 52 university and guild decision makers to resolve the raised missing gaps by the PWDs and the 53 means of communication explored were notable. Mubiru and Naturinda (2021) and Ipoh (2011) 55 for instance, attribute such a scenario to largely influence property users' satisfaction. Other 56 57 literature links it to eventual occupier turn over and mobility (Stronkhorst, 2005). Specifically, 58 59 for the PWD segment of property occupants, it influences a sense of social inclusion and 60 3 belonging. At times, shortfalls experienced in the inadequate communication and complaints 4 5 handling of issues raised by PWDs regarding the service provision of the campus properties 6 7 are avoidable. It happens largely as a result of failure to take responsibility for non-compliance 8 and design defaults by those charged with ensuring their effective performance. 10 11 The representation of PWDs on the campus decision making organs was observed to be below 12 par. As results indicate, if representation is done in its most participatory manner, it would help 14 the different organs to appreciate not only the variety but differing impairments to pay attention 15 16 to. In this way, relevant policies and actions would be crafted for the relevant building users. 17 18 However, in compliance with Kaufman et al. (2018), there are those users, though disgruntled 19 with the prevailing social environment, choose not to complain at all. This normally happens 21 when such users are resigned to the non-compliance and inadequate response to their concerns. 22 23 Despite the primary tenets of the social disability model, this paper avers that, property 25 management practice, social service provision and strategies to ensure inclusivity of all types 26 27 of property users are rarely upheld. In several instances, upon application and admission to the 28 29 university, the authorities adequately capture disability details and statistics of the students. 30 From thereon, no follow up strategies are recorded. Social inclusion of students, including 32 PWDs is largely left on paper. Dianito et al. (2021) from their study in the Philippines, attribute 33 34 such social exclusion tendencies to stereotypes and a society problem of not accepting PWDs. 35 36 While, Ravassard (2018) states that this in many countries leads to low enrolment and some 37 PWDs dropping out in due course, many of those students who remain studying are vulnerable 38 39 to inferior treatment and low self-esteem (Yeo and Moore, 2003). 40 41 The Tanzanian government policy on disability encourages social inclusiveness (Stronkhorst, 43 2005, Lameck, 2020), and even established in law against discrimination of PWDs (URT, 44 45 2010). However, results have indicated that university campuses pay limited attention to basic 46 47 prerequisites like orientation of the PWDs on how best to access the campus buildings and 48 provision of facilities that are compliant with their special needs. On-campus accommodation 50 that is commonly offered by university accommodation bureaus, but devoid of requisite PWD 51 52 compliant facilities has helped little in boosting equity in access and utilisation of campus built 53 services by PWD students. In many cases, the university authorities treat concerns of the PWDs 55 in a reactionary manner. In the end, PWDs and their building performance expectations end up 56 57 getting 'lost in the crowd', and with self-esteem dipped (Magsamen-Conrad et al., 2016). In 58 59 cases where social initiatives are pursued, these are done at personal basis and these are majorly 3 spearheaded by the students' leaders rather than the university administration. Once reactionary 4 5 initiatives are done, sustainability is rare to achieve. 6 7 This paper has established that social support initiatives and practices at the selected university 8 9 campuses are vague and there is no track of the university society having implemented them. 10 11 One of the most feasible ways of detecting this implementation would have been through the 12 provision of facilities and/or adjustment of the existing but non-compliant buildings. Findings 14 of this paper indicate that, buildings and services have various facilities to promote inclusive 15 16 learning although accessibility to them is non inclusive. From experiences shared, it was 17 18 apparent that the common excuses for the university communities not pursuing socially 19 inclusive initiatives for PWDs are attributed to the non-prioritised budgeting process that 21 eventually makes such initiatives appear expensive, an observation partly shared by Shukla and 22 23 Tambe (2018). The building services distribution at both campuses are indicative of lack of 24 25 prioritisation of social inclusivity of users by the design team. For instance, much as many 26 buildings are storied, provision of accessibility points like ramps and lifts plus all-inclusive 27 28 toilets are rarely prioritised by the property management teams. For facilities that were included 29 30 in the design, many were un-serviced and some have broken down. Oyenuga et al. (2012) 31 attribute such a tendency to poor maintenance culture which is exhibited in inappropriate 33 maintenance planning and maintenance policies. Furthermore, out of exclusion tendencies, 34 35 lecture and examination timetables are largely allocated and distributed with little focus on the 36 37 accessibility potential of the students, bearing in mind their respective disabilities. These 38 observations re-echo findings of Soyingbe et al. (2007) which emphasise the vital importance 40 of maintaining barrier free public buildings to promote usability to all users including PWDs. 41 42 Such services however are even inclusive of provision of adequate accommodation facilities 43 (Norton, 1997), compliant with PWD needs. 45 46 8. Conclusion 47 48 The paper has, through a qualitative approach explored the experiences regarding PWDs 49 inclusion in the use and access to public campus buildings. It has further justified the 51 importance of key tenets of the social and human rights models of disability in ensuring 52 53 equality and equity in the access and use of public campus buildings. The findings revealed 54 that, based on user experiences and narrations, disability inclusive facilities in higher learning 56 institutions are ineffective in terms of usability. There were eight facilities that were observed 57 58 in both external environment and inside the observed buildings. These facilities included; 59 60 pathways, disabled toilets, ramps, lifts, staircases, corridors, entrances, signage and doorways. 3 Through observations and interviews that were conducted with various staff members and users 4 5 of observed facilities, their usability was obtained. The study revealed that; much of external 6 7 environment is equipped with steps without provision of alternative route for physically 8 challenged people proving a nightmare for them to navigate around campuses. 10 11 It therefore calls for the Ministry of Education and Technology to ignite its supervision 12 mandate regarding implementation of PWD policies in public universities. At institutional 14 level, it is vital to ensure involvement of PWDs, through adequate representation in planning 15 16 and design of accessible built environment also to guarantee their participation in education. 17 18 Finally, property management departments should prioritise their budgeting strategies with 19 advance foresight of PWD student enrolments and, incorporation of their ever evolving built 21 environment needs and preferences. Among the priorities are; tailor made accommodation 22 23 rooms, representation of PWDs on university accommodation committees and guild councils 24 25 and social support for PWD mobility and manoeuvrability around campus. This would 26 eventually not only be helpful to students by also staff. 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 References 37 38 ADAMS, M. 2002. Learning, teaching and disability: the need for a new approach.
