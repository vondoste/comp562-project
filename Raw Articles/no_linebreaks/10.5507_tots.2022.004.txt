Identifying Barriers to the Public Transport Accessibility for Disabled People in Dhaka: A Qualitative Analysis SAHED HOSSEN SAJIB Department of Sociology, University of Barishal, Kornokathi, (Dhaka - Patuakhali Highway), Barishal, 8254, Bangladesh. ABSTRACT: This paper identified the barriers disabled experience in their daily lives using public transport as their travel means in Dhaka. A qualitative investigation of empirical data provides the framework for understanding passengers' experiences with public transport to deal with barriers. In the city of Dhaka, a focus group discussion (FGD) was held with a group of 34 disabled persons. They shared their per- ceived barriers from their own experiences with public transport. The barriers I found were negative attitudes by drivers, misplacement of priority seats, unfriendly built environment, high cost of travel, im- perfect design inside vehicles, prejudice and discriminatory attitude by other passengers, deficient levelling on transport infrastructure, long-distance between the transport stops/terminals and home, the profit-making tendency by transit boss, absence of audio support for the visually impaired, blockage in the footpath, fears of accidents and traffic injuries and wet or nasty weather. Then I suggested how we could solve their problems by increasing mobility, transport accessibility, social engagement, friendly attitude towards them, community or societal integration, and changing deep-rooted false cultural perception as well as prejudice. More research and studies are recommended to explore the accessibility challenges faced by people with disabilities in Dhaka using public transport. KEYWORDS: Transport Accessibility, People with Disability, Qualitative Content Analysis, Public Transport Introduction The disabled are a weak and marginalised group compared to the other social groups of urban communities in Dhaka, Bang- ladesh. They are also left out and unable to carry out their daily journeys. They stereotypically cannot get the freedom of mobility (the preconditions for participating in society) as non-disabled people get (Park and Chowdhury, 2017). Mobil- ity is necessary for every individual to participate in their community and society (Schaie, 2003). Transport mobility delivered necessary opportunities for individuals to manage their vital activities outside their home (Asplund, Wallin, and Jonsson, 2012; Brodrick and Stanley, 2013; Mollenkopf et al., 2005). Despite the numerous advantages of public transpor- tation, those with physical impairments tend to decrease their use of public transport (Broome, Worrall, Fleming, and Boldy, 2012; Mercado, Paez, and Newbold, 2010). The abil- ity of a public transportation system to convey people from their system entrance point to their system departure point in an acceptable period of time is referred to as accessibil- ity (Murray, Davis, Stimson, and Ferreira, 1998). Transport accessibility is more difficult and challenging for disabled people (Schlingensiepena et al., 2015). Sometimes transport is unavailable for them (Soltani et al., 2012). In Dhaka, people with all types of disabilities cannot access public transport (Sakaki and Gomes, 2018). The current interior characteristics of Dhaka's public buses do not accommodate the needs of physically challenged people (Sultana et al., 2020; Tauhid, 2007), although the bus is the predominant mode of public transport in Dhaka (ADB, 2021). Except for a few dedicated seats, there are no facilities for disabled people on present public transport (Sultana et al., 2020). Public transport ser- vice in this city cannot provide safe and easy mobility for per- sons with disabilities. Disabled people in Dhaka face various social, physical, and psychological barriers that disrupt their transport accessibility (Abir and Hoque, 2011). Besides that, people with disabilities are often listed as one of the catego- ries that could experience social exclusion due to reduced mobility (Kenyon, Lyons, & Rafferty, 2002; Barnes and Mercer, 2005; Casas, 2007) and lack of easily accessible travel options (Alsnih and Hensher, 2003). From a qualitative perspective, I attempted to analyse the difficulties of public transport accessibility for people with disabilities in Dhaka. I strive to provide in-depth and broader knowledge of their challenges, which cannot be conveniently assessed from other perspec- tives. I have also sought to understand how to overcome these challenges of disabled people in Dhaka. Research Questions What are the barriers disabled experience accessing public transport? Objective of the study My objective is to identify the barriers disabled people face accessing public transport in Dhaka. Literature Review Transport infrastructure is essential for accessibility (Wu et al., 2021). When a person exits the home, the complexities of accessibility in the public transport system begin (Park and Chowdhury, 2017, p. 2). Inadequate built environment and infrastructure make it difficult for disabled individuals in developing countries, e.g., see (Tennakon et al., 2020; Guimar√£es, Lucas, and Timms, 2019; Ahmad, 2015; Odu- fuwa, 2007), to travel unless they can be carried adequately throughout the entire route. The road system frequently lacks pathways in these countries. Those frequently exist are in poor condition, blocked by cars, trash, vendors, or road- side embellishment, absence of ramps and other accessibility elements (king and king, 2014; King et al., 2018). Low-quality tracks, such as rough exteriors due to cracks (Gallagher et al., 2011; Jenkins et al., 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2013), steeps, the need for ramps, handrailings, the lack of lifts (Iwarsson and Wilson, 2006) and a variety of other barriers obstructing accessibility on the way for disabled people (Darcy, 2010; Figueiredo et al., 2012) and makes manoeuvring challeng- ing for them. Especially those who depended on walkers and wheelchairs with physical deficiency. They exacerbate the danger of falling for vision deficiency too. The lack of curb ramps and steeps makes the situation worse, as they are unable to exit the footway to cross the street (Bromley, Matthews, and Thomas, 2007; Meyers et al., 2002; Rosenberg et al., 2013). Construction work was also identified as one of the major problems, expanding from signage spots and cones to the complete stoppage of the footways (Burdett and Pomeroy, 2011; Gallagher et al., 2011). According to Bezyak, Sabella, and Gattis (2017), people with mobility impairments encounter negative attitudes and lack knowledge of disability from drivers. The feeling of being bothered can be a significant barrier for disabled in trans- port (Aarhaug et al., 2011). The primary consequences of nega- tive behaviours are overt or implicit discrimination and social isolation (Yau, McKercher, and Packer, 2004). However, people with disabilities, on the other hand, are more likely than peo- ple without disabilities to face severe social exclusion and neg- ative behaviours as a result of their needs for care (McKercher and Darcy, 2018, p. 60). They can be pushed into ghettos due to a lack of transit accessibility (Gleeson 2006, p. 139). Lack of shelter and protection, low light, and security are public transport issues for disabled people (Crudden et al., 2015). Disabled people cannot use public transport due to the inability to access bus stops and stations (Haveman et al., 2013). Lengthy distances to public transport stoppages (Jan- suwan, Christensen, and Chen, 2013; Jensen et al., 2002) and the lack of different effective routes to terminal entries are also highlighted as barriers (Maynard, 2009). Platform ar- rangement, such as gaps and non-level access to platforms and buses/trains, has been identified as a predominant obsta- cle for people with disabilities. (Karekla et al., 2011; Soltani et al., 2012). Mobility levels may also be influenced by other physical factors such as traffic safety, the season of the year, and neighbourhood features (King et al., 2006). According to Asplund et al. (2012), physical obstacles while ascending, moving around, onboard, and disembarking are reflected as the most typical difficulties associated with an additional risk of accident for poor transport design. Espe- cially when standing in the buses. Priority seats in the car should be next to the driver as well as the entrance (Gallagher et al., 2011). Finding bus stations, detecting the correct bus, exchang- ing buses (which could include crossing the road), and iden- and non- Government performers in both urban and rural areas (WHO, 2015, p. 7). However, younger segments of the population are more dissatisfied with public transportation services and transportation capabilities for disabled persons in Dhaka (Munira and Santoso, 2017, p. 15). In this study, I tried to go beyond identifying the barriers disabled people face in Dhaka's transit system from a qualitative perspective. The find- ings from this literature review can guide the researchers and readers to develop more understanding of the barriers disabled people face accessing public transport globally. Research Method It was an exploratory qualitative research approach. Quali- tative research seeks to understand "the deeper meanings of particular human experiences" (Rubin and Babbie, 2011, p. 437). For a person with a disability, the barriers they face accessing transport can be found from their everyday experi- ences in transport. So, a qualitative approach was appropriate for this study. Focus group discussion (FGD) was chosen in this qualitative research as the data collection method. With researchers, participants, and a group moderator, FGD was completed in Dhaka (Kruger and Casey, 2015). Participants gave consent with their phone number and name. From the outset of FGD, I gave a transitory introduction to my research project. During FGD, I faced many problems with visually impaired, mentally imbalanced, and deaf participants. How- ever, we solve these problems with group dynamics and the social interaction feature of FGD (Morgan, 1996). FGD does not discriminate against participants whether they can read or write. It also encourages a reluctant participant who thinks he/she has nothing to say (Kitzinger, 1995). Participants' Information This paper defined disability according to the Disability Wel- fare Act of 2001 (Ministry of Law Justice and Parliamentary Affairs 2001). According to them, a person with a disability is medically impaired either congenitally or due to injury or an accident. He/she becomes physically inactivated, mentally imbalanced either partially or entirely, and cannot function or lead their everyday lives (BBS, 2015, p. 1-2). My respond- ents were physically impaired, visually impaired, physically inactivated, mentally imbalanced, according to this definition in this study. Without help, they are unable to live their nor- mal lives. With the help of the research team and their rela- tives, they participated in this study. Table one below demon- strates more detailed information on participants. tifying bus terminals are all common issues for partially or wholly blind people who use public transportation (Golledge & Marston, 1999). Where audio announcements are not pre- sent, they count on drivers to notify the stops for them. Since they count on memory to navigate, changes in the internal design of buses make it very tough for them to locate a seat (Gallagher et al., 2011). Furthermore, the lack of lights will cause trip hazards and make it impossible for low-vision pa- tients to read signs (Rosenberg et al., 2013). Other obstacles comprised the lack of pedestrian crossings, especially on bus- tling roads, the lack of audio announcements at road crossings (Bromley et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2017), and reduced degree of background sound that obscures audible details (Jenkins et al., 2015). In general, people with disabilities are given relatively a lesser amount of attention in public transportation facilities (Goggin 2016; Sheller 2018). Still, there has been little study on access solutions that are concentrated on the extent of the transportation network (van Holstein, Wiesel, and Legacy, 2020), where public transport is very significant for disabled individuals (Jansuwan, Christensen, and Chen, 2013; Velho et al., 2016). Article 9, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities emphasises to confirm an equal "transport accessibility" for persons with disabilities by both Government Note. Information on participants. Table 1. Participant's Profile Sampling I collected information from 34 respondents using the non- probability snowball sampling method. Once we managed to participate someone in the discussion, they informed us about another one they knew. Sometimes their parents or their relatives did it for us. It was not easy to find disabled participants for this research. So, I followed this type of snow- ball sampling method. In the qualitative study, the appropri- ate sample size is an extent that can sufficiently answer all the research questions. The required information becomes evident with the study's progress (Marshal, 1996), and new themes, explanations are stopped emerging from collected data. This point is called data saturation in qualitative re- search (Marshal, 1996; Guest et al., 2006). Data Analysis Procedure Qualitative content analysis (QCA) was applied to analyse the data. First, I transcribed the group discussion into tex- tual data (meaning unit). I used the conventional qualitative content analysis method because I gathered the themes and levels from the textual data (Forman and Damschroder, 2007) and avoided preconceived categories (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). Then, I slightly edited all the meaning units eliminat- ing incomplete sentences, replicating words, and non-rele- vant content while maintaining their main context. It is called condensation (Erlingsson, & Brysiewicz, 2017). Qualitative content analysis interprets the textual data with a systematic process of coding. Code identifies themes and patterns from data (Flick, 2014). In this research, coding was generated by labelling meaning units with a code using an open coding process. As the study progresses, more data becomes avail- able, and codes are changed concerning the research context (Berg, 2009). Thus, themes and contents were created through coding. From these themes, contents, and words, I drew in- terpretation and result of the study (Bengtsson, 2016, p. 10). The internal consistency of the coding was strengthened as the researcher who conducted the analysis attended all of the focus groups sessions and communicated with the other members of the research group on a frequent basis as the analysis developed (Kidd and Parshall, 2000). In this analy- sis, some sub-categories and the codes of the meaning units are the same (Graneheim and Lundman, 2004). From these sub-categories, main categories and themes were generated. Themes and main categories are broad ideas that describe an underlying meaning and provide an answer to the inquiry (Graneheim and Lundman, 2004). Following that, I provide the analysed data to the actual groups (respondents and their relatives) to ensure that their ideas were correctly recorded (Kagaari et al., 2017). Formulating Themes and Categories from the Discussion For example, Interview Quotation "When it is a rainy day or bad weather, we cannot come out of our home, and there is no chance for us to get transport. As we have to use the mobility aid, we cannot use an umbrella‚Ä¶ " Con- densed Meaning Unit "We cannot manage to access the transport because of nasty and damp weather. As we have to use a mobility aid instrument, we cannot save ourselves from rain or bad weather. We cannot easily take shelter in a covered place like others on the road where rain cannot pour" [Female, 29 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). Code "rainy or bad weather". The theme was that bad weather severely inter- rupts the travel of disabled people in Dhaka. They cannot access transport for it. Findings and Discussion In this part, I discuss and interpret the findings of my study. The first section discusses the barriers to transport accessibil- ity. Then I illustrated the way to remove these barriers. The first section has a few quotations from FGD. I translated the discussion from Bengali to English and removed the name of the participants. Barriers By asking participants to ponder the public transport envi- ronments, the barriers were found below. Due to rough surfaces, rocks, trash, cracks, steeps, and the absence of the ramp on the road, disabled people have to face difficulty getting on public transport. More precisely, the built environment is unfriendly and awkward for them to travel in Dhaka. The associated meaning units were: "The structure and design of the road infrastructure are not appropriate for us. There are no ramps on the road. It is almost impossible to get on the bus. The rough surface, rocks, trash, cracks, and construction materials on the road make moving more challenging for us". [Male, 26 years old] "I never move smoothly with my wheelchair on the road. I always fear going out with the wheelchair. In fact, roads are not suitable for us (the wheelchair users)". [Female, 23 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). Disabled people face negative attitudes from drivers and transit contractors. The below meaning unit is also a deter- miner of another thing that the transit bosses have very little knowledge about disability in Dhaka. So, they care for their interest instead of helping the disabled people in Dhaka. The significant condensed meaning unit was: "Drivers are reluctant to pick us up when they come to know that I am impaired. Because it is more time consuming for drivers to take an impaired person than normal people and we also need help to get in the transport. In the centre of the busy road, drivers stop vehicles that show complete contempt for the lives of travellers." [Male, 26 years old] (Group discus- sion, 2020). "Getting on the vehicle takes more time than normal com- muters for us. So, transit bosses try to avoid us for more income taking normal people than us." [Male, 34 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). Separated places, highlighted labels, and alternative ways in transport systems can be a blessing for disabled people in this capital. However, these are absent in the present trans- port system. What is present in this transit infrastructure Figure 1. Steps of Qualitative Content Analysis is not appropriately maintained. These inappropriate set- tings in transit platforms and transit stops act as barriers for disabled people to access public transport in Dhaka. The meaning units were: "Bus stops are far away from my home. When I try to get on or come off from bus or other types of transport, I have to struggle with the distance between transport stops and home" [Male, 26 years old] "There is no separate passenger shelter, no adequate light- ing, and no different level or margin for us. Even though they are not usable for the lack of proper maintenance." [Male, 26 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). The road and footpath are blocked by the hawkers, vendors, and the informal sectors. Due to the construction work, con- struction materials are kept on the roadside in Dhaka. Thus, a considerable portion of the road remains unusable for the disabled in Dhaka. These blockages create a barrier for them getting on public transport in Dhaka for the disabled. The meaning unit from the discussion was: "Roads and footpaths have always been developed and re- stored. A huge portion of roads, especially pavements, are always covered by construction materials. Hawkers and infor- mal sectors also occupy footpaths." [Female, 22 years] (Group discussion, 2020). Disabled cannot get on the vehicle, usually like us. Ac- cidents and injuries are evident to every respondent while getting on the vehicle. They have to struggle due to the im- poverished inner vehicle design and misplacement of priority seats in this city. Priority seats are not the same in public transport. The placement of priority seats in Dhaka's trans- port is different. It is annoying for the disabled as many of them use only memories for identifying seats. In Dhaka, sometimes careless men frequently occupy the allocated seats for disabled people and do not share their seats with disabled people (Sajib, 2021, p. 28). Thus, they face discrimi- natory attitudes from non-disabled passengers. The associ- ated meaning units were: "I can never securely get on and off in public transport. I was injured several times, getting on the vehicle. Inside the trans- port, the design and infrastructure are not friendly with us. Placement of the priority seats does not take a similar pattern in all vehicles. They are varied remarkably and cause problems for us" [Male, 26 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). "Some passengers take the seat reserved for the disabled and women. Some are reluctant to share a seat with us" [Fe- male, 23 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). Generally, travel costs for people with disabilities are higher (Freeman and Selmi, 2010; Kastenholz et al., 2015; Yau et al., 2004). It is also relevant in Dhaka. The related meaning unit was: "Transit managers claim a more considerable amount of money than other passengers. Sometimes the bus contractor, drivers, and the transport supervisor expect more money for additional assistance in public transport." [Male, 26 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). "We have to take someone to accompany us on our visit. It also increases transportation costs." [Female, 30 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). Wet and nasty weather causes an issue as the disabled are unable to hold an umbrella using the mobility aid at the same time (Park and Chowdhury, 2017. p. 6). They are also unable to protect themselves from rainy and damp weather like non-disabled people. So, they face difficulty accessing public transport during bad weather. It was also found in a meaning unit below: "We cannot manage to access the transport because of nasty and damp weather. As we have to use a mobility aid in- strument, we cannot save ourselves from rain or bad weather. We cannot easily take shelter in a covered place like others on the road where rain cannot pour " [Female, 29 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). Thus, wet and nasty weather is a barrier to access transit for the disabled in Dhaka. Barriers and obstacles for the blind and visually impaired are slightly different from other disabled. Some visually im- paired can see, but it is not appropriate for making a jour- ney. They face the same barriers as others mentioned before. Among them, lacking information, absence of audio messages, and exact schedules were recognised as barriers to accessing public transport in this study. The meaning units were: "It is terrible for me to find a specific transport. I cannot change the bus and do not know the right route as there is no au- dio support. So, we have to rely on others." [Male, 32 years old]. "I found it very difficult to read the notification and other signs on the road. Even in most cases, the exact schedules are not maintained, and the traffic lights, roadside headlights are wrecked." [Male, 29 years old] (Group discussion, 2020). From this discussion with respondents, it becomes clear that the obstacles they encountered accessing public transport impacted their daily journey very depressingly. In other words, it can be generalised that an inaccessible and inadequate transportation system in Dhaka prompts disabled people to refuse to leave their homes for their daily journey. Suggestion and Problem Solving It is possible to improve the life quality of disadvantaged com- munities and promote societal cohesion in the long term. A key aspect of community cohesion is secure, reliable, and afford- able transportation (Sze and Christensen, 2017). Barriers-free and better access to travel have been attributed to greater mobility and social engagement, promoting a more positive life quality perception (Banister and Bowling, 2004). However, these barriers to mobility are triggered by the elaborate so- cial attitudes that non-disabled individuals have built around such impairments rather than by the physical impairments themselves (Pierson, 2010, p. 34). People described disability as an absolute and permanent inability to work in everyday life (Nicolaisen, Blichfeldt, and Sonnenschein, 2012). It is not the correct perception. A man with little ability in one area might have high capability in another area (Buhalis et al., 2005, p. 16). Instead of proposing the society understand their diversity of capability or be structured to be respectful of their difficulty, people with disabilities believe they must conform or adapt themselves to the structure (Nicolaisen et al., 2012). Thus, they are accepting the culturally rooted prejudice and negative perception towards them. From the perspective of contract theory, people who have contact and interaction with the disabled have a positive attitude towards the disabled group (Daruwalla and Darcy, 2005; Pettigrew and Tropp, 2006). This aspect of interaction can help to abolish discriminatory attitudes towards the disabled community. Responsiveness of government directives and institutional collaboration in strategic urban planning is crucial for enhancing the walking environment and accessibility of transport conveniences and services (Hallgrimsdottir et al., 2016). Furthermore, geospatial details about accessible services for pre-trip planning were deemed helpful for people with reduced mobility (May et al., 2014; Aarhaug and Elvebakk, 2015). Visually disabled individu- als cannot use the architectural solution designed for people with mobility disabilities. Instead, they require an assort- ment of augmentative and alternative communication devices (AAC), just like Teletext decoders, sensory or tactile markers (Chang and Chen, 2011; O'Neill & Knight, 2000). A journey is a complicated sequence of events, and for it to be procurable, each connection in the chain must function properly (Wenn- berg, Hyd√©n, and St√•hl, 2010). So, every aspect of the journey should be focused equally to eliminate these barriers in their accessibility chain.

These images were collected from Dhaka. The identities of people and places were removed (Personal collection, 2021). Conclusion Disabled people are disadvantaged members of society. Hearing their desires would make them feel more included in the community. Their travel needs are adventuresome like ours (Ray & Ryder, 2003). So, they need a user-friendly transport system for travelling. Barrier-free accessibility in public transport systems can change the lives of persons with disabilities (United nation, 2007). Many development objectives, such as access to health care, work, and social contact, rely on physical connectivity and transportation (Julie et al., 2018). Being disabled, they are deprived of these typical development initiatives too. We construct the barriers they face accessing public transport. So, our responsibility is to make the transport system more usable, comfortable, friendly, and considerate for disabled people. Besides that, public transportation operators should work more closely with core stakeholders of disability communi- ties. It is not possible to make a sustainable society keeping a large community deprived and excluded. This exclusion and deprivation can be eliminated by increasing mobility and accessibility to public transport. Besides that, cities like Dhaka will be more resilient if there is equal partici- pation of the disabled community. The researcher believes that the barrier-free transport system can bring this equal- ity for the disabled and make their life more enhanced in Dhaka. Limitation of the Study This research did not include multifaceted barriers that inter- act simultaneously in the present quality of public transport for the disabled in Dhaka. Besides, it could not include Inter- mediate Public Transport (IPT) like rickshaws, three-wheeler autos, as they are more expensive to rent than other means of transport. They are also restricted from entering the few Metropolitan areas (the midpoint of the capital) and can not cover the city-wide route in Dhaka. Drivers of these transpor- tations (such as rickshaws) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, according to Bhuiya (2018) and Tauhid (2007), are reluctant to carry or support the disabled to board. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I am cordially grateful to all my participants and their rela- tives. Besides, this study was motivated by the study of Jun Park and Subeh Chowdhury: Investigating the barriers in a typical journey by public transport users with disabili- ties, Journal of Transport & Health, Volume 10, 2018, Pages 361-368. So I am also grateful to them. FUNDING SOURCES I did not receive any funding for this research.
