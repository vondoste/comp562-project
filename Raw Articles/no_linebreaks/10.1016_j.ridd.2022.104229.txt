Box 2431, BE-3001 Leuven, Belgium A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Architecture Built environment Challenging behaviour Intellectual impairment Quality of life A B S T R A C T Background: Behaviours that challenge might prevent intellectually impaired individuals from experiencing a good quality of life (QoL). These behaviours arise in interaction with the envi- ronment and can be positively or negatively affected by architecture. Aim: This scoping review explores how architecture contributes to the QoL of individuals engaging in such behaviours. It aims to identify possible gaps in the existing literature and map areas of future research. Method: Four databases were searched using four concepts: architecture, intellectual impairment, challenging behaviour, and QoL. Since only one source covered all concepts, the search criteria were widened to include sources integrating only two or three concepts, nonpeer-reviewed sources, and autism. Eighteen papers, were analysed in terms of their contribution to relations between QoL, behaviours that challenge, and architecture. Results: This review shows that architecture, QoL, intellectual impairment, and behaviours that challenge have not yet been studied jointly. Conclusions: The contribution of architecture to the QoL of these individuals should be subject of future research, together with the similarities and differences between their needs and those of individuals with autism. Introduction Many intellectually impaired individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge live in inadequate environments that may affect their QoL negatively (Bradley & Korossy, 2016; Olivier-Pijpers, Cramm, & Nieboer, 2019), instead of in a home where they can ex- ercise choice and are treated with dignity (Bubb, 2014). In the Netherlands, two cases of individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge, illustrate these living conditions bare of dignity, a sense of home, and choice. Both persons' QoL improved greatly when their treatment and living environment was changed (Van Zijl, 1999; Vriesema, 2012). To prevent individuals from escaping or becoming aggressive, spaces are sometimes made to feel sterile, stripped of a sense of home, and in some cases even inhuman. Healthcare organizations tend to respond by trying to contain behaviours that challenge through policies and procedures (Farrell et al., * Correspondence to: Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Academy of Architecture, Zuiderkuipen 19, 9711 HR Groningen, The Netherlands.

Parris & Watson (2011, p. 30) explain that the lack of control of individuals engaging in such behaviours over their physical, interpersonal, and programmatic environment may lead to a vicious cycle: 'Environmental factors lead to an onset of this behavior, which in turn leads to the person's environment becoming more restrictive (less access to activities, less control etc.). This restrictive environment may in turn lead to an increase in behavior, which may lead to further environmental restrictions.' These behaviours arise in interaction with the environment and can also be positively or negatively affected by architecture (Bradley & Korossy, 2016; Carpenter, 2011). This scoping review explores how architecture contributes to the QoL of individuals engaging in such behaviours. It aims to identify possible gaps in the existing literature and map areas of future research. Four concepts were applied in the literature search: architecture, intellectual impairment, challenging behaviour, and QoL. These concepts will be explained briefly below. Architecture The architecture of a building can be regarded as a layered structure. Brand (1995) distinguishes six layers: Site: location; Structure: foundation and supporting structures; Skin: exterior of the building; Services: technical 'guts' of a building; Scenery: fixed interior arrangement; Stuff: interior arrangement. The architecture of a building encompasses all layers, but has a particularly strong focus on structure, skin, and scenery. Mostafa (2014a) goes beyond this building-focused boundary and includes its impact on humans. She defines architecture as the art and science of creating environments that improve its users' QoL. Similarly, Di´eb´edo Francis K´er´e – an architect from Burkina Faso and Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize – considers architecture as a means of improving individuals' QoL (Hales, 2005). Ulrich et al. (2008) demonstrated these positive effects of architecture on patient outcomes, such as with nature views and daylight. Ar- chitecture also has the potential to affect social relationships and the connection between individuals by stimulating chance encounters that might lead to a deeper connection (Leaman, 2005). Contrarily, features related to architecture like (lack of) privacy or (too much) noise can influence stress (Mobach, 2009). Stress can also be triggered by an environment that causes uncertainty, lacks control, and presents too much novelty (Sternberg, 2009). Architecture is considered one of the most crucial factors influencing a person's QoL (Health Council of the Netherlands, 2009). We define the concept of architecture as comprising a layered structure of building properties with the potential to positively influence human life. Intellectual impairment Individuals with intellectual impairments may experience significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behav- iour, which covers many social and practical skills (Schalock, Luckasson, & Tass´e, 2021). Traditionally, the conception of disability is considered as an individual physiological disorder which could possibly be solved by aiming to restore the body's functions (Heylighen et al., 2017). The social model, on the other hand, considers this an impairment and understands disability arising from interactions with the environment and could possibly be solved by design interventions (Heylighen et al., 2017). We chose to use the term 'intellectual impairment' because we believe "disabled is not something one is, but something one be- comes" (Moser, 2005) and although it might not be universally used we use this term throughout this review. Intellectual impairments frequently co-occur; for example, individuals on the autism spectrum may have an intellectual impair- ment (intellectual developmental disorder) (APA, 2013). Autism is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by def- icits in social communication and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (Hodges, Fealko, & Soares, 2020). Moreover, since a high percentage of individuals with intellectual impairments engaging in challenging behaviours have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum, (Carpenter, 2011; Green et al., 2018), we chose to include both concepts, intellectual impairment and autism, in our search. Challenging behaviour Challenging behaviour is defined by Emerson (1995) as culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency, or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is likely to be placed in serious jeopardy. These behaviours could be considered as a way of communicating distress and unmet needs by individuals who are unable to communicate in more conventional ways (Bradley & Korossy, 2016; Green et al., 2018). Challenging behaviour threatens the QoL of those involved (Bradley & Korossy, 2016), may lead to exclusion from society (Oli- vier-Pijpers et al., 2019), and cause those showing it to be 'one of the most vulnerable groups in society' (Woodward, 2011). Historically, such behaviours have been framed as 'problem' or 'challenging' behaviours suggesting that these were individual characteristics. Interventions focused on attempting to change the individual (Bradley & Korossy, 2016). The term 'behaviours that challenge', on the other hand, implies a relation between the context and the individual showing this behaviour (NCCMH, 2015). Behaviours that challenge are a serious and common type of behaviour among individuals with a mild to profound intellectual impairment (Embregts et al., 2009). The main reasons for engaging in behaviours that challenge include, next to pain, a desire to increase social attention, to escape undesirable situations, to adjust levels of sensory stimulation, or to increase access to preferred objects or activities (Emerson, 1995). We understand behaviours that challenge as an interaction of individuals with their (social, sensory, and physical) environment and a way of communication. We used this concept of challenging behaviour in our search since it is the most common term for this behaviour, but we use the term 'behaviours that challenge' throughout this article. Quality of life Numerous studies over the last two decades have explored the QoL of intellectually impaired individuals, since they may have a lower QoL than other people. To define the QoL we apply the, most commonly used, framework by Buntinx and Schalock (2010): eight domains provide an indication of an individual's QoL in the areas independence, social participation, and well-being, namely: personal development, self-determination, interpersonal relationships, social inclusion, rights, emotional well-being, physical well-being, and material well-being. The World Health Organization (1997, p. 1) defines QoL as "individual perceptions of their position in life in the context of culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns". As definition of the QoL we combine the framework by Buntinx and Schalock (2010) with the context relatedness of the definition of the World Health Organization (1997). Interrelatedness Now, we explore the possible interrelatedness of these concepts. The interaction between an individual with unique needs and their environment which may not support these needs, may result in behaviours that challenge (Bradley & Korossy, 2016; NCCMH, 2015) and reflects the stress the living environment produces on these individuals. Understanding these possible stressors will help to reduce this stress (Carpenter, 2011). Therefore, more knowledge is needed on the interrelatedness between the living environments, these individuals, and their QoL, since research relating architecture to behaviours that challenge remains underexplored (Casson et al., 2021). This raises the question 'how architecture can contribute to creating environments that enhance the QoL of intellectually impaired individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge'. Method Study design We chose to conduct a scoping review since it is considered the most effective method to address a broader area that has not been researched comprehensively (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005). Unlike a systematic review, a scoping review does not aim to assess the Fig. 1. Final search string. Table 1 Selected sources.

We followed the principles of conducting a scoping review introduced by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010). Our search strategy was based on four relevant concepts related to the research question: (i) architecture; (ii) challenging behaviour; (iii) intellectual impairment and autism; and (iv) quality of life. The interrelatedness of the four concepts is included in the search string with the 'AND' function. Related search keywords were identified based on MeSH terms, synonyms, keywords from relevant sources, and self-determined search words. Several test searches, conducted to enhance the number of relevant articles, led to the search string as shown in Fig. 1. These searches led to a broadening of some concepts: e.g., adding well-being and quality of existence to quality of life. The database search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Avery, on October 1st, 2021. Inclusion and exclusion criteria A scoping review adopts similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as a systematic review, but the criteria may be devised post hoc, based on an increasing familiarity with the literature (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005). The search process was conducted in collaboration with a research librarian. Initially, we had planned to include only literature that covers all four relevant concepts. Several test searches yielded too few sources (articles, papers, books, etc.) meeting the inclusion criteria, revealing a need to add the results from searches covering all combinations of only three concepts for the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, namely: (i) architecture; (ii) challenging behaviour; (iii) intellectual impairment and autism. In Avery no sources were found that met the inclusion criteria. The combination of the concepts (i) architecture and (ii) challenging behaviour showed no results. The combination of the concepts (i) architecture and (ii) QoL revealed results irrelevant for this review. Therefore, a reduction to two concepts was necessary, namely: (i) architecture and (ii) intellectual impairment and autism. Since the research question focuses on the contribution of architecture it was important to always include the concept of architecture. Also, articles addressing behaviours that challenge unconnected to intellectual impairment or autism were excluded. Moreover, the search in Avery had to be broadened to non-peer reviewed articles, since relatively few archi- tectural journals are peer reviewed. The timeframe was set from 2006, to align with the United Nations' adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to October 2021. Data extraction and analysis The database search yielded 655 sources, which were reduced to 241 based on a screening of the titles. After the abstracts were screened, 42 sources were retained. After a screening of their reference lists and a hand-search for relevant sources, 27 handpicked sources could be added. Screening the full text of 69 articles allowed downsizing the selection to 18, of which 8 were hand-picked. Only one source covered all four of the concepts; the others also delivered information relevant to the research question, Table 1. There are several reasons why only so few sources were retrieved. Firstly, in social and behavioural sciences, the term 'environ- ment' is mostly considered as social, rather than physical. Moreover, the term 'architecture' is often used as a synonym for construction or ICT design. Although this review focuses on the living environment of adults, it includes studies on school settings, which is what most literature on autism and architecture focuses on (Deochand, Conway, & Fuqua, 2015; Mostafa, 2010). The full-texts were analysed in relation to the research question. The findings were then ordered based on the exemplary indicators of the Quality of Life conceptual and measurement model by Buntinx and Schalock (2010) (Table 2). Were several options of ordering were possible we chose the one most in line with the context and meaning of the article. Since differences might exist between the needs of individuals showing challenging behaviour and those of individuals on the autism spectrum, and to identify possible gaps in the research, we distinguish findings concerning behaviours that challenge and those only related to autism, which is mentioned accordingly. Findings The findings of the18 retrieved sources are connected to the QoL by using the Quality of Life conceptual and measurement model by Buntinx and Schalock (2010) (Table 3). Listed under architectural means are findings that may inspire architects and other participants Table 2 Factors, Domains and indicators of the Quality of Life conceptual and measurement model by Bunting and Schalock (2010)'.

Independence Buntinx and Schalock (2010) subdivide the factor independence into the domains (i) personal development and (ii) self-determination. Personal development For individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge, it seems beneficial to provide them with challenges and access to meaningful activities that respond to their interests (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021). Autistic individuals may experience the physical environment as a place of confusion and anxiety (Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Li & McAllister, 2012). One way of dealing with this phenomenon is to protect them from these feelings by minimizing external stressors, making them increasingly dependent on this stress-free environment, a so-called greenhouse effect (Li & McAllister, 2012; Mostafa, 2008, 2010, 2014a, 2014b). This de- pendency hampers their development by not preparing them to cope with real-life challenges (Li & McAllister, 2012; Mostafa, 2008, Mostafa, 2010, 2014a). Personal development might be supported by providing challenges, e.g. through creating various environ- ments with different spatial and sensory properties (Mostafa, 2008, 2010, 2014a). Self-determination The findings on self-determination relate to two themes: accessibility, being able to move freely and independently, and assistance, being supported by the architecture and staff. Concerning accessibility, research suggests that, if the physical environment restricts individuals' movements or prevents their activities, they may become frustrated and show this through behaviours that challenge (Parris & Watson, 2011). Access to the whole building may provide a sense of self-determination (Brand & Rca, 2010). Therefore, an non-restrictive layout might support them in moving around the premises independently (Brand & Rca, 2010). Also, access to the neighbourhood and its services can help them to engage with purposeful activities (Brand & Rca, 2010). With respect to assistance, routine is important for individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge, as it makes life more pre- dictable for them (Parris & Watson, 2011). Autistic individuals may be more anxious (Carpenter, 2011) and may have less developed orientation and navigation skills than neurotypicals (Kinnaer et al., 2015; Li & McAllister, 2012). Creating predictability and mini- mizing the unknown are said to be important stress-reducing factors for individuals who are on the autism spectrum and/or engage in behaviours that challenge (Brand & Rca, 2010; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Li & McAllister, 2012; Mostafa, 2008, Mostafa, 2010, 2014a; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). A logical layout providing transparency, offering a preview of the space (Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009), can also assist in assessing potential social interactions (Brand & Rca, 2010). The use of half walls or screen partitions helps divide a room and at the same time maintain visibility (Brand & Rca, 2010). Glass panelling in doors and minimizing blind corners assist in avoiding unplanned social encounters (Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010). This transparency and clear sightlines also help care providers to monitor in a less obtrusive way (Brand & Rca, 2010). A building layout that reflects routine is said to minimize stress and assist users to orient themselves (Brand & Rca, 2010; Li & McAllister, 2012; Mostafa, 2010, 2014a, 2014b; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). Also, understanding spaces is easier when they are each assigned one activity and sequenced according to the routine (Mostafa, 2010). Visual cues can assist in providing clarity, unconscious wayfinding and may support the independence of individuals with autism and/or engaging in behaviours that challenge (Brand & Rca, 2010; Deochand et al., 2015; Khare & Mullick, 2009, 2010, 2014a; Parris & Watson, 2011). Fostering independence might require creating ample space for assistance to allow working simultaneously and/or create possi- bilities for personal assistance (Khare & Mullick, 2009; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010). Social participation Social participation encompasses the three domains (i) interpersonal relationships, (ii) social inclusion, and (iii) rights (Buntinx & Schalock, 2010). Interpersonal relationships Possible triggers that may lead to behaviours that challenge are a lack of choice in social interaction, such as the amount of staff attention; the distance to family, staff or peers; the number of persons around an individual; the presence of a disliked person; or the inability to leave a setting (Embregts et al., 2009). In interpersonal relationships, autistic individuals can be sensitive to proximity and potential loss of personal space. They might feel threatened by crowding and show this with behaviours that challenge (Kinnaer et al., 2015). Other people's actions can cause confusion and might be experienced as unpredictable (Kinnaer et al., 2015). Also, autistic individuals may have difficulties in handling socially demanding situations, but may dislike being alone, instead seeking proximity to rather than active engagement with others (Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). Comparable to individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge, autistic individuals seem to be sensitive to a lack of choice in interpersonal relationships. This choice can be provided in the form of escape possibilities, such as various peripheral escape spaces where one can retreat to when overwhelmed but also interact with others (Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Li & McAllister, 2012; Mostafa, 2010; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). The choice to contact others is supported also by creating a variety of spaces for interaction (Parris & Watson, 2011). This provides the opportunity to belong to the group and at the same time control the distance to others. A generous space standard, but of domestic scale, may also provide personal space, psychologically and physically, and support individuals in dealing with social interaction (Casson et al., 2021; Brand & Rca, 2010; Embregts et al., 2009; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer et al., 2015). Social inclusion Social inclusion and (informal) social relationships are important for the QoL of intellectually impaired individuals (Khare & Mullick, 2009; Mostafa, 2014a; Tatlow-Golden et al., 2014). However, despite being physically included in the community, many of them have '…little sense of belonging and membership, and few meaningful relationships with non-disabled community members…' (Tat- low-Golden et al., 2014, p. 34). Creating a variety of environments for interaction might enhance opportunities for participation and inclusion (Deochand, Con- way, & Fuqua, 2015; Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010), by offering communal areas affording different types of interaction that enable informal contact with the neighbourhood (Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). Another way of promoting participation of individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge is to involve them in the decoration of their own or communal rooms (Parris & Watson, 2011) but also in adjusting their home environment to the desired level of social engagement (Brand &, 2021). Rights For individuals with autism and/or engaging in behaviours that challenge, the importance of a home as a sanctuary, where one has control without intrusion of others, contrasts sharply with the situation of individuals living in an institutional setting (Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mo¨hn, 2021). What would benefit their dignity is choosing a neighbourhood that accepts diversity and supports its inhabitants (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Kinnaer et al., 2015) and providing a homelike environment (Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010; Mo¨hn, 2021). Aspects influencing homelikeness include architectural factors like the size of rooms, openings, and the finishing materials (Casson et al., 2021). Homelike materials make it possible for these individuals to associate their living environment with regular living environments and provide them with a sense of human dignity (Mo¨hn, 2021). Well-being Well-being covers (i) emotional, (ii) physical, and (iii) material aspects (Buntinx & Schalock, 2010). Since analysing the sources yielded no results about material well-being, the findings focus on emotional and physical well-being. Emotional well-being For individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge, emotional well-being can be fostered by providing homelikeness (Parris & Watson, 2011). These individuals and those with autism may, inadvertently or deliberately, damage the physical environment, possibly with a communicative intent (Brand & Rca, 2010; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Mo¨hn, 2021). The damages may make these in- dividuals lose their confidence and prevent them from engaging in activities (Brand & Rca, 2010). Therefore, it is recommended to use homelike, robust materials to prevent reflecting traces of their behaviour (Deochand, Conway, & Fuqua, 2015; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Mostafa, 2018; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010). To support their emotional well-being individuals with autism and/or behaviours that challenge should have opportunities for personalization (Casson, et al. 2021; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Li & McAllister, 2012; Parris & Watson, 2011). The perception of homelikeness is also influenced by factors such as sound, illumination, temperature, and humidity, e.g. a higher sound level and a higher humidity are perceived as less homelike (Casson et al., 2021). This suggests that the indoor environmental comfort level may influence the sense of homelikeness (Casson et al., 2021; Mo¨hn, 2021). In order to foster emotional well-being and reduce stress in individuals with autism or behaviours that challenge, clarity and order are suggested to be helpful (Brand & Rca, 2010; Embregts et al., 2009; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Li & McAllister, 2012; Resnik & Black- bourn, 2009). Also, individuals with autism may be distracted from activities when they experience a high degree of detail or disorder in their surroundings (Brand & Rca, 2010; Mostafa, 2010, 2014b). Autistic individuals may also have difficulties in processing visual stimuli (colours, patterns, or lighting) (Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2008, 2014a). Therefore, creating visual calm allows creating a sense of clarity and order (Embregts, Didden, Huitink, & Schreuder, 2009; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010). Examples include designating areas for things and putting them out of sight (Deochand, Conway, & Fuqua, 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010). Obvious layout, a clear organization of spaces, and simple forms may help individuals with autism or behaviours that challenge to find their way in the physical environment more easily (Casson et al., 2021; Deochand et al., 2015; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2014a). Findings suggests that an environment which is too quiet, too exciting, or too noisy may cause stress, which in turn may trigger behaviours that challenge (Embregts et al., 2009; Parris & Watson, 2011). Also, some autistic individuals are hyperreactive to the sensory aspects of the physical environment (Khare & Mullick, 2009; Li & McAllister, 2012; Mostafa, 2008, Mostafa, 2010, 2014a, 2014b). This suggests that having opportunities for sensory adjustment might enhance emotional well-being (Brand & Rca, 2010; Parris & Watson, 2011). Through their design, architects affect the sensory input and can try to reduce the sensory overload before, rather than after, behaviours that challenge occur (Mostafa, 2008, 2014a). To provide the opportunity for sensory adjustment, an escape space is recommended (Mostafa, 2008, 2014a, 2018), allowing individuals to retreat to when overwhelmed by sensory stimulation, offering a sense of control and safety (Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Mostafa, 2008, 2014a; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). An escape space should be activity-free, quiet, calming but not sterile, intimate in size, and provide tactile stimulation (Mostafa, 2008, 2014a, 2018). For some autistic individuals providing a sensory room, an acoustically contained room where one can modify sensory inputs such as lighting, texture, and sound, might be a valuable addition to the tranquil spaces (Mostafa, 2008, 2014a). Sensory and escape rooms thus offer sensory adjustment and can complement each other (Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2014a). Acoustics are considered the spatial factor that is most influential on autism and possibly on behaviours that challenge (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Deochand et al., 2015; Embregts et al., 2009; Mostafa, 2008, 2014a, 2018; Parris & Watson, 2011). Several studies conclude that architects should create good acoustic qualities and not only muffle the existing noise by extensive soundproofing, but prevent noise in the first place (Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Mostafa, 2008, 2010, 2014a; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). To realize a good acoustic environment architects may consider external walls that filter outside noise, the size and direction of the openings as well as the size and form of spaces, separation of floors and walls (Brand & Rca, 2010; Mostafa, 2010). A possible greenhouse effect could be avoided through compartments of high and low stimulus zones, a gradual series of acous- tically modified spaces, allows sensory recalibration (Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Mostafa, 2008, 2014a; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). Sensory adjustment also includes appropriate lighting and temperature since these might trigger behaviours that challenge (Parris & Watson, 2011. Physical well-being Good lighting and (cross-)ventilation are also important for the QoL of individuals with autism or behaviours that challenge (Casson et al., 2021; Brand & Rca, 2010; Mostafa, 2010). There are sources that recommend to maximize natural light to enhance alertness (Deochand, Conway, & Fuqua, 2015; Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010), whilst others warn for an over-stimulation of hyper-visual autistic individuals and possible distractions by visual accessibility of the outside (Mostafa, 2010). Good possibilities to (cross-)ventilate can prevent high temperatures and odour and may minimize sensory overload (Casson et al., 2021; Brand & Rca, 2010). Literature suggests that the health of individuals with autism and/or engaging in behaviours that challenge may be enhanced by creating a safe environment, since they have an altered sense of their environment (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2010, 2018; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). This may suggest using high-quality robust, non-toxic materials with a tolerance for unintended or misuse, fixtures, and appliances, and easy-to-clean surfaces (Casson et al., 2021; Khare & Mullick, 2009; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). Features that prevent injury (e.g. for individuals with an hyporeactivity to temperature and pain) such as: preventing access to risky areas; installing safety fittings to protect from hot water; and avoiding sharp edges, may provide a safe environment (Casson et al., 2021; Brand & Rca, 2010; Mostafa, 2018). But overly protective measurements, features, and finishes may induce a feeling of containment and institutional atmosphere and trigger be- haviours that challenge (Brand & Rca, 2010). Recreation can promote the vitality and health of individuals with autism and/or engaging in behaviours that challenge. Some of them may spontaneously undertake motor activity like jumping and pacing (Kinnaer, Baumers, & Heylighen, 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010). Therefore, spaces that encourage physical movement may motivate physical well-being (Deochand, Conway, & Fuqua, 2015; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009; Brand and Rca, 2010), e.g. large communal rooms with high ceilings to allow jumping and pacing (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021). Locating physical activity spaces centrally and with an easy visual and physical access encourages the use of these spaces (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021). Discussion This scoping review explored how architecture contributes to the QoL of individuals with intellectual impairments engaging in behaviours that challenge. Its aim was to identify possible gaps in literature and map areas for future research. Recent reviews either have addressed the influence on such behaviours of (re-)settlement and housing on behaviours that challenge (Casson et al., 2021; Oliver et al., 2020; Tatlow-Golden et al., 2014) or the social, physical, and organisational environments (McGill et al., 2020; Van den Bogaard et al., 2019), or have focussed on the QoL of individuals engaging in such behaviours (Bigby, Beadle-Brown, 2016). This review shows that the four concepts – architecture, QoL, intellectual impairment, and behaviours that challenge – have not yet been studied jointly and this study is therefore novel to the field because of its integrative approach. Some studies combine results on intellectually impaired individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge with results on in- dividuals with autism (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al. 2021; Deochand et al., 2015). This study, however, shows that differences exist between the needs and wishes of both groups, such as the significance of accessibility, e.g. by a non-restrictive layout (Brand & Rca, 2010; Parris & Watson, 2011), which seems to be particularly relevant to individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge. There are also many similarities such as the importance of predictability, visual cues, and clear wayfinding (Brand & Rca, 2010; Mostafa, 2014a). choice in interpersonal distance (Casson et al., 2021; Brand & Rca, 2010; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2014a), e.g. through spaces close to communal areas, escape possibilities. a generous space standard and participation (Brand & Rca, 2010; Parris & Watson, 2011; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009), e.g. by having access to services and ample opportunities for interaction. a sense of home (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Parris & Watson, 2011). sensory adjustment (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Parris & Watson, 2011; Mostafa, 2010, 2014a), e.g. by escape rooms, good acoustics, or high/low stimulus zones. clarity and order by visual calm or a clear layout (Casson et al., 2021; Kinnaer et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2010, 2014a). health by a physical environment that encourages physical activity and provides good lighting and ventilation (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Deochand et al., 2015; Mostafa, 2008, 2014a, 2018). There are also findings that point to specific needs of (some) autistic individuals, e.g. the specific need for clarity and order in the form of compartmentalization of spaces, layouts that reflect routine, familiarity and comprehensibility (Mostafa, 2008, 2010, 2014a, 2014b). The fact that these needs were not found in literature about individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge does not mean that they may not be relevant for their QoL. Limitations The initial search, based on the four concepts relevant to the research question showed a lack of research on their interrelatedness, this lack is supported by literature (Casson et al., 2021, Mostafa, 2010). Only after we widened the search criteria more relevant sources could be retrieved. These sources were not assessed on their respective quality (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005), therefore, further research is needed to substantiate our findings. The scarcity of available literature asks for humbleness in making recommendations. Nonetheless, we do hope that the summarized recommendations of the findings (Table 3) add to a better understanding of the topic. Furthermore, the keyword 'architecture' was used for the search to emphasize the focus on the physical environment, potentially limiting the search results. The search string included several terms describing disability but since various terms are used worldwide, it might mean that we did not retrieve every source on the topic. Since it is a scoping review and therefore aimed at mapping the relevant literature (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005), we are confident that this scoping retrieved enough articles to generate relevant findings. Literature suggests that a connection exists between intellectual impairment, autism, and behaviours that challenge (Carpenter, 2011; Embregts et al., 2009), which is paralleled by our results. Many strategies or architectural enablers (as shown in Table 3) overlap and seem equally relevant to both groups. In order to further substantiate these results, they should be supported by empirical research. Moreover, since autism encompasses a spectrum, one size does not fit all (Carpenter, 2011; McAllister & Li, 2012). For most autistic individuals, however, it might be adequate to design for a range of their most common characteristics, such as sensory sensitivity (Carpenter, 2011; Mostafa, 2014a, 2014b; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009) and a need for personal and physical space (Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009). Yet, these findings may not apply to all individuals with autism or behaviours that challenge. In our attempt to connect the findings to the Quality of Life conceptual and measurement model by Buntinx and Schalock (2010) (Table 2), we divided the findings into the different goals and means (Table 3). We carefully considered the context in which these findings were described and connected them to the QoL as consciously as possible. Since only one source included all four concepts the findings of the other sources had to be connected to the Quality of Life conceptual and measurement model by Buntinx and Schalock (2010) to our best judgement. This process does not do justice to the substantive cross-links that also exist, but we are confident that they cover the intended meaning of the initial sources. We realize that the choice of model and the execution of the ordering is one of many ways to connect architectural means to the QoL of intellectually impaired individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge. Gaps in research This review shows a gap in research on how architecture can contribute to the QoL of intellectually impaired individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge. Although there is some research found that provides recommendations (Brand & Rca, 2010; Casson et al., 2021; Resnik & Blackbourn, 2009), there also seems to be a substantial lack of design guidelines that can be used by professionals in architecture, facility management, or real estate in order to build an enabling physical environment for this audience. Also, there are studies on autism in relation to architecture, of which school settings receive the most attention (Mostafa, 2010). Much can be learned from these findings, but this review shows a gap in knowledge on the similarities and differences between the needs of individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge and those of individuals with autism. Recommendations for future research Future research, on the contribution of architecture on the QoL of individuals with intellectual impairments engaging in behaviours that challenge is needed and may confirm the relevance of our findings. Also, empirical research on the similarities and differences between their needs and those of autistic individuals is recommended. The observation that a high percentage of individuals with intellectual impairments engaging in behaviours that challenge are also diagnosed with autism (Carpenter, 2011; Embregts et al., 2009) serves to illustrate this. What this article adds? Behaviours that challenge arise in interaction with the environment and could be considered as a way of communicating distress and unmet needs by individuals who are unable to communicate in more conventional ways. Architecture can also positively or negatively contribute to this behaviour and influences the QoL of intellectually impaired individuals engaging in it, which is explored by this scoping review. This review identifies gaps in the existing literature and maps areas of future research. It also shows that architecture, QoL, intellectual impairment, and behaviours that challenge have not yet been studied in relation to each other. The scarcity of available literature asks for humbleness about making recommendations. Nonetheless, we summarized recommendations of the findings and hope to add to a better understanding of the topic. This study also provides insight into the similarities and differences between the needs of intellectually impaired individuals engaging in behaviours that challenge and those of individuals with autism.
