Entire routing planning is a prerequisite to ensuring the appropriate navigation, especially for pedestrians with visual impairments. This paper focuses on optimizing the initial indoor route selection before micro-navigation. A new travel utility schema is defined to represent a user's travel confidence with regard to different types of obstacles and a user's acceptable level of travel difficulty. The applicability of the model is evaluated using the layout data from a real bus terminal. The results show that the pedestrian doesn't always select the shortest path as assumed in existing papers, and will make detours to destinations to cut down the travel difficulties. Although the current use case focused on people with visual impairment, the framework is generable to support other users such as users with wheel chairs and users with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to use public facilities independently.



Introduction

Independent travel in complex building facilities such as trans- portation hubs is tremendously problematic for people who are blind or have a visual impairment. Almost one-third of the whole population with visual impairment reports not being able to navigate within their community by themselves even with the help of guide dogs and/or a Hoover cane [4]. Currently, there exist assistive navigation technologies that make it possible to substitute the company of a "sighted guide" (i.e. sighted assistant) for pedestrians with visual impairment. This innova- tion will enhance their independence and community access. The nav- igation involves two key action components: mobility and orientation [18,34]. Mobility focuses primarily on micro-navigation to ensure safe movement through space without running into objects. It includes sensing

[10]. While the second component, also labeled as macro- navigation, involves navigating the remote environment beyond that
which is immediately perceptible. It consists of being oriented, route selection (or wayfinding), and executing routes to the destination. Micro-navigation has been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature such as detecting obstacles, locating, and correct heading in the near fields, while the studies on macroscopic routing planning for the entire travel are limited and still lag behind. This deficiency will degrade the performance of whole navigation applications because route planning is a prerequisite to travel orientation. Especially in the case of visual impairment, the absence of route selection optimization will cause an increase in travel difficulties and durations, which can enlarge the hurdles of independent movement, and augment the po- tential occurrence of injury. Additionally, every pedestrian has their particular criteria for route selection owing to their various levels of travel difficulty, independence, and confidence. It is not practical to generalize identical route selection rules for every pedestrian with visual impairment. Therefore, this paper will target entire route optimization for pedestrians with visual impairment to address the problematic issue of macro-navigation considering customized requirements.

To date, a few studies on macro-navigation have been conducted and representative research topics have included positioning [17], spatial layout analysis (Rafian and Legge, 2017), and developing assistive orientation system [20,24]. However, the existing research focused primarily on the processes after the determination of the entire route
selection, and they gave limited consideration to route planning opti-
follow. Weyrer et al. [32] tried to develop the geospatial barrier catalog and a web-based prototype to select the barrier-free path. However, the detailed routing optimization model was missing and the limitations would augment the difficulty in route selection especially when multiple alternatives can be chosen. Additionally, although the existing studies have also considered travel obstacles [8,29], few of them has integrated individual user preferences into route planning, and the criterion of route selection was limited to single objectives.

oped a client system for pedestrians with visual impairment to connect geographical data with route selection criteria. The multi-criteria rout- ing was proposed according to the different requirements of pedestrians to achieve potentially conflicting objectives of minimum route length and risks. Kammoun et al. [16] proposed a route selection algorithm for blind pedestrians to choose an optimal pathway between an origin and a destination. A common point for these studies is that they selected the routes based on certain criteria, and gave little consideration to sys- tematic route optimization. To summarize, the limitations of existing routing optimization compared with this study are presented as follows:
(1) route planning was restricted to one destination, and the travel constraints were not considered such as the upper/lower time bound of activity, the acceptable level of travel difficulties and the constraints for the travel flow balance. Whereas in this paper, multiple activities with fixed and random sequences are both considered to formulate a sys- tematic route selection optimization model subject to the aforemen- tioned constraints. These constraints could ensure that the optimal solution of the optimization model is more suitable in practice and improve the applicability of the model. (2) The personalized re- quirements of different pedestrians were generally regarded as similar in
tangible factors including the confidence, desire and independence level. Kurose et al. [35] assumed that pedestrians would take the shortest path between individual destinations. While, the shortest-path route was not always followed in practice because safety is the most basic requirement for visual impaired people and they try to avoid noisy
to accept a longer but safer route [30]. To address these limitations, a travel utility is defined in this paper to represent each pedestrian's individual preferences in time requirement, confidence, and the acceptable level of difficulty. On this basis, the personalized travel requirements can be satisfied to the most extent compared to the generalized optimization goals in the previous studies. Building information modeling (BIM) contains detailed geometric and semantic information about buildings including their indoor envi- ronment [9], and it is widely regarded as one major technological advance in deriving information appropriate for navigation [3]. Among many other capabilities, it can enable spatial queries about locations and navigation paths through spaces [13,21,28]. For example, Isikdag et al.
[13] proposed a BIM-based model dedicated to facilitating indoor nav- igation by providing detailed semantic information along with 3D ge- ometries. Rueppel and Stuebbe [25] developed a BIM-based indoor emergency navigation system to provide for routing within a public

building and provided travelers with important information in their particular spatial context when the emergency happened. Xu et al. (2017) used BIM as the input data to enable efficient indoor path planning considering obstacles in the multi-floor buildings. In these studies, however, the optimization mechanism was not considered in routing, the methods proposed in these studies can hardly satisfy various travelers with different travel requirements and preferences. In this paper, we design a route selection optimization model that can use building semantics information such as locations of indoor pathways and staircases, walkway slopes, building functional layouts, and travel obstacles (furniture, trash cans, etc.) as well as personal travel prefer- ence and schedules to recommend optimized travel choices for blind users.
The route selection optimization with multiple destinations, in this paper, can be formulated as an operation research problem for which mathematical formulations were developed to derive the optimal or near optimum solution to support blind users' decision-making on route
choices. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a typical route opti- mization question in other domains [1,7], and the traveler will visit each one of multiple locations and then return home. The route with the lowest cost was pursued in the interest of route selection optimization [11]. Algorithms have also been proposed to find solutions for the extremely large TSP [2,14,19]. In this paper, the pedestrian needs to make a single visit to each activity location. This similarity with the TSP makes the modeling method feasible in the domain of pedestrian route optimization. However, the routing problem in this paper has its unique characteristics: (1) the visual impaired traveler will not return back to the start location; and (2) the optimal objective is more complicated when considering the personal requirements of travelers, the total travel time, and travel difficulties. Additionally, two scenarios exist in practice in terms of the activity sequence including the fixed and random orders. On this basis, a novel route planning optimization model for pedestrians with visual impairment was proposed in this paper to facilitate macro- navigation for indoor travel.

Personalized travel utility of blind pedestrians

Route planning is the first step during the course of navigation for pedestrians with visual impairment. The route selection can facilitate users to preview the upcoming journey before travel, to access an overview of the path to follow. Additionally, different pedestrians have various travel requirements and acceptable levels of difficulty, and hence the route selection criteria should be customized. The indepen- dent and confident travelers generally prefer the shortest routes even if it maybe involve difficulties. While other conservative pedestrians

would pursue a more prudent path which is longer but easier to follow. Each travel path can be divided into several segments with different types of transit obstacles. The typical obstacles during the indoor travel are tabulated in Table 2, which represents different travel difficulties for

 trash cans and other furniture items in the travel paths which can
 impede the straight movement of a blind pedestrian. The "corner/
 intersection" refers to the corners of interior building structures (i.e.
 walls) or the intersection of interior pathways. Generally, straight, wider
 and uncrowded walkways are preferable route elements, and blind people prefer the shorter and easier routes especially when the time is a chosen consideration. In this regard, the blind pedestrian hopes to avoid the elements such as the stairs, narrow sidewalk, large open areas, and [18]. Additionally, different blind people can accept
various difficulty levels during travel if these obstacles cannot be avoi- ded. A travel utility is defined in this paper to represent the degree to which a given travel path choice for a blind pedestrian is better than other travel path choices in terms of travel difficulty. It is basically the difference in travel difficulty between a given path and the path with the maximum difficulty. It is a more mobility related parameter considering the unique travel challenges for blind pedestrians. In other words, the travel utility represents the personalized preferences over different route selections. The higher travel utility indicates that the selected route is much safer and this pedestrian has more confidence to pass it. A blind pedestrian will first grade the travel difficulty for different types of route segments using a scale from 1 to 5 based on their own criteria of the acceptable level of transit difficulty and confidence. On this basis, the travel difficulty of k route for the blind pedestrian is equivalent to the total difficulty scores of all obstacle segments in k route, which can be represented by Eq. (1). The travel utility for the selected route, denoted by μ, is equal to the difference between the maximum difficulty and the actual undergoing difficulty of the selected route μ as shown in Eq. (2). D(k) = Qm Sm × Rmk, k = 1, 2, …, Qk (1)
U(μ) = Max{D(k) } D(μ), k = 1, 2, …, Qk (2)
Where m (m = 1, 2,…, Qm) is the serial number of obstacles during indoor travel, and Qm denotes the number of obstacle types. Qk is the
quantity of potential path to be selected. D(k) and U(k) are the person- alized difficulty score and the travel utility of the blind pedestrian with k route selection, respectively. Sm denotes the personalized difficulty score of m obstacle for the blind pedestrian. Rmk represents the quantity of the m-type difficulty segments in the k path.
The customized travel utility of each route alternative can be calculated for every blind pedestrian using Eq. (2), which denotes the satisfaction level for the travel difficulty to go through. A larger utility value represents a lower level of travel difficulties. The pedestrian will
optimize their route selection to maximize their travel utility if the time is not limited. Otherwise, they may reduce the utility to pursue a shorter travel duration if the activity is urgent. This paper tries to achieve the trade-off between the travel utility and the travel time to pursue a customized route selection for blind pedestrians with various transit requirements.

Route planning optimization modeling

A systematic route selection optimization model is proposed in this paper considering the personalized acceptable level of travel difficulties for various pedestrians. The framework of the model is illustrated as shown in Fig. 1. First, the locations of the activity to be conducted, potential route choices between every two activities and the allowable travel time are input into the model. The blind pedestrian will grade different types of obstacles in Table 2 according to their acceptable level of difficulties. On this basis, the travel utility of this pedestrian will be calculated, which is individualized and varies with his or her previous practice, confidence and personality. Subsequently, the travel routes will be optimized using a route selection optimization model to pursue the maximum travel utility and minimum travel time. The optimization is divided into two categories according to the activity sequences. If the event has to be conducted in a fixed order, only the route selection be- tween every two events will be optimized. Sometimes, the activity has no direct relations and their sequences are random. The sequence of activities will first be scheduled in this scenario, followed by the opti- mization of route selection between every two activities. Finally, the optimal travel plan can be provided including the event sequence, route selection, travel time and the utility. This optimization model could support the decision makings on the navigation of blind pedestrians from the whole view. The navigation system will customize the travel route for each blind pedestrian with the input of the activities to do and their acceptable level for difficulties. Note that the route optimization in this paper is in pursuit of providing overall route planning information during the course of navigation, while the detailed guidance for each step is not considered.

Route optimization for fixed-order activities

The travel will be incurred when the pedestrians with visual impairment needs to conduct series of activities. The activity sometimes has inherent sequential orders owing to their correlations between each other, and hence these events have to be finished in a fixed sequence. For example, the pedestrian has to buy the tickets (activity 1) first before boarding the train or airplane (activity 2). In this situation, just the travel routes between different activities need to be optimized. Let μ be an arbitrary route selection plan, and the optimization objectives of route optimization are to maximize the travel utility and minimize the

calculated by Eq. (5). The travel utility of the selected route can be
calculated by Eq. (6) which is defined as the difficulty differences be- tween the one that the blind pedestrian goes through during this travel

Therefore, the completion time of i activity is equivalent to the completion time of (i - 1) activity plus the sum of the duration time of i activity and the travel time between these two events locations as shown
in Eq. (9). The travel time between every two contiguous activities is defined in Eq. (12). Where Tmk is the general travel time of m-type
Route optimization for random-sequence activities

On the other hand, the sequential order of the activities may be random during the tour. The route optimization can be divided into two steps in this scenario, including (1) activity sequence scheduling and (2) routing optimization. As shown in Fig. 3, the next activity needs to be selected every time from the remaining activities and the route alter- natives connecting these two activities will also be optimized. This paper proposes the random-sequence-activity route optimization model to address these problems on the basis of Section 4.1. The model can be summarized as the multiple optimization objectives in Eq. (3) subject to the constraints of formulas (8)–(11) and (15)–(25).

middle escalator at the Main level to arrive at Level 4 via Level 2. On the other hand, the three activities in Scenario 2 have no fixed order, and hence the route selection can be divided into six categories: Restroom-
 Coffee Food, Restroom Food Coffee, Food Coffee Restroom, Coffee Food Restroom, Coffee Restroom Food, and Food Restroom Coffee. Each category has 4 alternatives and three typical groups of alternatives are detailed in Table 5. The difficulty score Sm for each type of segments Om in Tables 4 and 5 is graded by the pedestrian to represent the difficulty level for him to pass through. The values are assumed and illustrated in Table 6 based on the literature review [18]. The proposed model can serve other pedestrians with visual impairment by adjusting the personalized difficulty score Si.
In this case study, the general travel time of the m-type segment Tmk is denoted by the inverse of the travel speed in this segment type Vmk, and we assume that the travel speed of the same segment type is same in different routes for simplification. The average travel speed of blind
pedestrian in the normal walkway (m=6) is set as V6=1.22 m/s [23],
and the walk speed in other segment types is assumed to be equal to the walk speed in the normal walkway multiplying the ratio of the difficult scores between the normal walkway and segment type m as formulated in Eq. (26). Besides, the activities in this case study don't have the fixed upper bound, and thus Li is set zero, which can be modified in other situations if there are special requirements.

Results and discussions

The normalization of the two objective functions U and CT is con- ducted owing to their different magnitudes and measures. The minimum (fMin, i*) and maximum function values (fMax, i*) in scenario i (i = 1, 2)
are computed individually based on the constraints of Eqs. (4)–(25): fMin,

(2) Several random-order activities are designed in the second scenario including grabbing a cof- fee, buying food, and going to the restroom. The coffee and food store located at Level 2. The restroom at Level 2 and Level 4 can both be selected as illustrated in Fig. 4.
The walkway information of route segments at different levels is tabulated in Table 3. On this basis, the distance and the difficulty level of possible routes in each scenario can be deduced as shown in Tables 4 and

This proposed model is solved using Lingo 11.0, the software widely applied in formulating diverse optimization problems. The values of WT and WU, more importantly the ratio between them imply how a blind pedestrian values available time for travel against travel utility (indi- cating how travelable a path is considering his/her own mobility chal- lenges). The weight value can be modified in practice according to the actual preferences of different pedestrians, and the pedestrian can pro- vide their own ratio of these two objectives according to their own travel situations. To examine the validity of the proposed model under various extreme objectives and conditions, six scenarios with different weight distributions of objective functions are considered. Their optimal objective values are tabulated in Table 7. First, assuming that the weights of two objective functions WT and WU both equal 1/2. This in- dicates the time and the travel utility of difficulty level matter similarly to the pedestrians with visual impairment. Second, the single objective situation is individually considered in the case of fixed-order and

random-sequence activities. Scenarios 1 and 4 with even weight distri- butions serve as the reference scenario to compare the effects of different goals on the solutions. On this basis, the increments of objective values compared to the reference scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 5 and each optimal solution for fTand fU is also marked.
The comparison of travel utility with different route selections is conducted to investigate the impacts of travel utility on the route se- lection. Take the fixed-order activities for example (Scenarios 1–3), the
difference of travel utility between each route alternative and the optimal selected route in each scenario is calculated as shown in Fig. 6. For simplification, the potential six routes of "Subway exit Escalator Ticketing plaza Boarding gate 415" in Table 4 are defined as routes No.1–6, and the other six routes of "Subway exit Elevator Ticketing plaza Boarding gate 415" are marked as routes No.7–12. Note that the route number with red color represents the selected route in each scenario, and the travel utility of this route is set as a reference value. For example, the difference of travel utility in
the No.1 route is -1.28, which represents the travel utility of the No.1
route is smaller than that of selected route No.12 (utility = 5.11). Similarly, the difference of travel utility in the scenario of random-
sequence activities is illustrated in Fig. 7. The results in Figs. 5–7 and Table 7 are discussed below, and the following observations can be made.

Table 7 and Fig. 5 reveal that a 23.29% increase of the travel utility occurs when it is the sole objective during route selection compared to the reference case in the fixed-order scenario

(Scenario 1). However, the utility will be reduced by 48.34% when the travel time goal is individually pursued. The dimin- ishing trend also appears in the random-sequence scenario when the travel time is minimized (Scenario 6). Fig. 6(c) also suggests that the travel utility of the optimal route when minimizing the travel time is mostly lower than that of other alternatives. In this paper, the travel utility defines the satisfaction for the travel difficulty that the pedestrian will go through if the route is selected. Hence, it can be concluded that the goals of travel time and the travel difficulty level may conflict with each other, in particular in situations like the shorter paths have high travel difficulty for blind users. In this situation, the unconfident pe- destrians with visual impairment can make a detour to the destination to cut down the travel difficulty level if the time is sufficient, and this proposed optimization model can facilitate the route selection to achieve the trade-off between travel utility and travel time. This also calls for a more inclusive design in indoor travels for people with visual impairments as the current designs give limited considerations to these vulnerable populations.
It can be shown in Table 7 that the priority of the objective function impacts the final route selection. With respect to the fixed-order scenario, two alternatives of routes can be chosen from the Main level to Level 4. The shortest route directly from the Main level to Level 4 is selected when considering the travel time (Scenarios 1 and 3). Whereas, the pedestrian is suggested to make a detour via Level 2 to arrive at Level 4 to avoid the sloped
walkway when the maximum travel utility is pursued (Scenario 2). This result indicates that the pedestrian doesn't always follow the shortest path as assumed in the previous literature because the travel difficulty and safety is the basic requirement for visual impaired people. They would prefer a longer but easier and safer route to avoid crowded intersections or difficult segments. These findings can enlighten the navigation design for visual impaired people to consider the personalized travel requirements.
Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate the difference of travel utility in each route in the scenario of fixed-order and random-sequence activity, respectively. The figure shows route No.3 (B C Level 2 K
 Level 4 N) has the lowest travel utility when the sequence of activity is fixed. It is owing to the additional lobby and corner when taking the rear escalator K at Level 2. In the scenario of random-sequence activity, route No.14 (N Q R Level 2 H G L N) outperforms other alternatives with respect to the travel utility because its quantity of lobby and corner seg- ments is smallest. While route No.10 (N R Level 2 G I
 H J N) is most difficult to pass due to the detour to the restroom of Level 2 and the additional lobby to take the rear elevator of Level 2. We thus conclude that the pedestrians with visual impairment should avoid the
tersections to reduce the travel difficulty when selecting the routes. These results are consistent with the personalized re- quirements designed in this case study.

Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis of parameters in the case of fixed-order activity is conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed model. In this paper, the last activity of getting on the bus has a time limitation, and hence the pedestrian has to arrive at the Boarding gate 415 before the bus leaves. The upper bound of the time TQ is selected in this section to investigate the relations between the changes of the parameter and the optimal
solutions. The upper bound is set as TQ = 60 min in the previous case study. Changes of -6%, -12%, 6%, and 12% are applied to this base
value to compare the changes of objective values fT and fU in different scenarios. The results are shown in Table 8.
The table suggests that the reduction of time bound TQ can affect the optimal selection of routes in Scenarios 1 and 2, while the objective values and optimal solutions remain the same in Scenario 3. It is because the time needed to pass the selected route in Scenario 3 of the reference
case (TQ + 0 %) is 52.26, which is much smaller than the time limitation
when reducing TQ by 6% and 12%. Whereas, the selected routes will consume 53.28 min and 57.66 min in Scenarios 1 and 2 of the reference case, respectively. Hence, these optimal routes cannot be selected owing to the time exceeds the limitation when TQ is decreased by 6% or 12%. On the other hand, the objective values and optimal selection will not change when TQ is increased gradually because the augment of the upper bound allows for more time to select the far route but with a low level of travel difficulty.

Conclusions

A systematic routing optimization model is proposed in this paper to address two questions: (1) optimizing the entire route selection for pe- destrians with visual impairment before travel navigation; and (2) addressing the problematic issue of macro-navigation considering personalized travel requirements. Two cases of fixed-order and random- sequence activities are investigated to improve the applicability of the proposed model. Finally, the applicability of the model is evaluated using a bus terminal model with six scenarios with different priorities in objectives. To summarize, the contributions of this study can be shown in the following.
A travel utility function is defined in this paper to represent the personalized requirements of travel satisfaction considering the travel confidence, the types of route segments, and the acceptable
level of travel difficulty.
Practical travel considerations including multiple destinations, the sequence of activities, various difficult levels of different route seg-
ments, and the time-bound of each task are investigated in the pro- posed model. This addresses the limited considerations of the real- world navigation environment in previous studies.
The routing optimization model of indoor travel in this paper tar-
geted the stage of entire route planning prior to the orientation. In contrast, existing studies primarily focused on the process after the determination of routes selection as well as supporting the decisions for the outdoor micro-navigation. Hence, this paper fills the research gaps on the initial route selection of indoor macro-navigation.
In summary, the proposed model builds a foundational model for supporting navigation decision makings for pedestrians with visual impairment in complex indoor environments. In our future work, the optimization model will further evaluate whether the sequence of travel obstacles impacts disabled users' route choices and if so how can we represent it in the route optimization model. Our future work also in- cludes implementing the optimization model into an App service and test it with human subjects in real-time navigation with the ultimate purpose of evaluating user experience and further refining the model.
