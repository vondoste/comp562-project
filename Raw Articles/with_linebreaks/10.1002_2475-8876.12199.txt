Abstract
The CASBEE-Wellness Office (hereinafter CASBEE-WO) was launched in June 2019 as a new CASBEE tool for assessing buildings and workplaces from the view- points of workers' health, workplace productivity, and resilience. In this paper, we introduce the structure of the evaluation system. The tool development has begun in response to emerging demands following recent social movements related to PRI and ESG investments. The new tool has added a function that eval- uates wellness factors in the building evaluation process using the CASBEE fam- ily. While CASBEE-WO can be used alone, the simultaneous evaluation with existing CASBEE tools can be selected. Two types of new building certifications are launched. The "Wellness Office" is the one certified with CASBEE-WO alone, and the "Smart Wellness Office" is the simultaneous certification with the exist- ing CASBEE tools. The technical background, such as the correlations with other evaluation tools, CASBEE-OHC and WFun, is also explained. It shows that the CASBEE-WO can properly evaluate buildings providing a work environment to reduce the risk of a high work functioning impairment. The third-party certifica- tion process has been started, and the data are analyzed. The new version was released in May 2020 to fix some defects found through the analysis.

Introduction
While the green building rating systems, such as LEED,1 BREEAM,2 and CASBEE,3 are becoming an indispensable tool for sustainable building design in the SDGs (Sustainable Devel- opment Goals) era, a new system for assessing the health and intellectual productivity of office workers has been developed. WELL Building Standard4 is one of the new systems that was launched in 2014, and buildings certified by this system are increasing rapidly. Other tools, for example, Fitwel,5 are avail- able6 and have been promoting a new trend to evaluate building values by their health and wellness aspects. While the conven- tional rating systems mainly focus on how to design green build- ings, the new systems were developed to rate some new features of buildings and communities related to the wellness and health of office workers by measuring, certifying, and monitoring the built environment.7 Although these rating systems are intended to be used internationally, the demands of regional variations
due to the differences in climate, social background, etc., have caused the various tools to be simultaneously developed and widely used in each society.8,9 With this background, the CAS- BEE-Wellness Office (CASBEE-WO) was launched by the Institute for Building Environment and Energy Conservation (IBEC) in Japan and started its certification in 2019.10 The unique feature of the developed tool is putting emphasis on eval- uating the building basic performances including safety and security related to building resilience, while other existing sys- tems such as WELL Building Standard put emphasis on realized built environments directly. The development philosophy is based on ideas that building basic performances are necessary to realize an ideal workplace. For instance, building structures allowing flexible planning are required for building tenants to realize their desiring office planning. Moreover, building fea- tures that secure safety and security are necessary to provide reassuring work environments. Buildings equipping those basic performances should be properly evaluated in recent real estate

markets in this SDGs era. In this paper, we introduce the outli- nes of the new tool as well as the background data accumulated on the developing process. Moreover, building data certified in 2019 are shown, and the trend in recent Japanese buildings con- sidering wellness is discussed.

What is the CASBEE-Wellness Office?
Concept
The CASBEE-Wellness Office (CASBEE-WO) is a new build- ing assessment system launched by the Institute of Building Environment and Energy Conservation (IBEC) in Japan. In the development of CASBEE-WO, "wellness" was considered as an active process aimed at enhancing well-being,11 and the wellness office was defined as "an office building that enables office workers to improve their workplace productivity in a healthy state." In Japan, overwork due to long working hours has become a social problem, and there is a strong demand for improvement in workplace productivity. Therefore, while other tools are building the main evaluation items by measures that directly secure the physical and mental health of workers,4,5 CASBEE-WO added workplace productivity improvement as the viewpoint of evaluation. Furthermore, since Japan is a coun- try with frequent natural disasters, we have built an evaluation system in addition to the viewpoint of evaluation to improve resilience for the purpose of continuing business safely. The spread of building certifications utilizing this system is expected to promote ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) invest- ments in the real estate market. Following the United Nations- formulated Principle for Responsible Investment (PRI), the sys- tem has been developed to evaluate buildings and workplaces from the viewpoints of health, workplace productivity, and resi- lience. Today, the Japanese government is actively promoting so-called "work style reform" to ensure healthy work environ- ments and management systems. This movement also boosts a new social trend, and it requires new systems to evaluate these factors in buildings and built environments.
"CASBEE for Buildings" was launched in 2001 and is the
first and core tool of the CASBEE family, a generic term for the whole system of CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency).3 It evaluates the building environmental performance and has become a well- known system all over world.12 It has been used as a de facto standard to assess buildings in Japan in terms of environmental performance. While the tool itself originally includes a part of the factors related to building environments in ESG invest- ments, it does not fully cover some of the social aspects. CAS- BEE for Real Estate was launched as a member of the CASBEE family to promote investments in the real estate mar- ket with consideration of the environmental aspects, although it also does not cover all of them. In these contexts, a new function to reinforce the workers' health, workplace productiv- ity, and resilience factors in the building assessment process using the CASBEE family was expected to meet the above- mentioned new social movements. Responding to the newly raised demands, the development of CASBEE-WO was started to cover the new factors in buildings and workplaces raised by the new movement in ESG investments. It also conforms to the "Office Building Certification System for Health and Com- fort of Workers" published by the Ministry of Land, Infrastruc- ture, Transport and Tourism in Japan. The outlined structure of CASBEE-WO is shown in Figure 1.

existing CASBEE tools can extend the conventional building

evaluation into a new phase responding to the new social demands. In particular, the simultaneous assessment using CASBEE for Buildings or CASBEE for Real Estate is recom- mended. The actions are promoted by setting two types of new building certifications: "Wellness Office" and "Smart Wellness Office." The former certifies CASBEE-WO alone, and another can be achieved through the simultaneous certifications with CASBEE for Building or CASBEE for Real Estate. The "Smart Wellness Office" is defined as an office building that achieves sufficient performance both in the conventional fac- tors related to building environmental performance and the new factors related to workers health, workplace productivity, and resilience. The certification of CASBEE-WO itself can be applied for any ranked buildings as well as the existing CAS- BEE tools. The certification itself does not credit the building performance but verify the information disclosed by the score sheet. On the other hand, the certification of "Smart Wellness Office" requires rank B+ or above for the evaluation using CASBEE for Buildings or CASBEE for Real Estate. The certi- fication of "Smart Wellness Office" accredits that the most of the ESG factors related to real estate and facilities are evalu- ated and the result is organized in the right way for informa- tion disclosure. The system is expected to be used by private companies for their information disclosure. The third-party cer- tification has been implemented since June 2019.
Basic structure
CASBEE-WO comprises two main evaluation items, "basic performance" and "operations and maintenance, etc." The first one, basic performance, is sub-divided into three sub-items, "Qw1. Health & Comfort," "Qw2. Convenience," and "Qw3. Safety," and includes 47 evaluation elements. The second one, operations and maintenance, etc., is sub-divided into two sub- items, "Qw4. Operations, maintenance and management" and "Qw5. Program," and includes 13 evaluation elements. The whole structure is shown in Table 1.
The function of evaluating service levels related to building operations and maintenance as well as its management is a unique feature of CASBEE-WO, while other existing tools such as CASBEE for Buildings focus on evaluating building performance itself. On the other hand, CASBEE-WO does not evaluate an aspect of environmental load reduction that is orig- inally evaluated in other CASBEE tools because of the simpli- fication intended to focus on the new feature.

Rating system
CASBEE-WO rates buildings in five ranks: C (poor), B-, B+, A, and S (excellent). In the original CASBEE tools, Built

Environment Efficiency (BEE) is used for the rating.3 BEE is a unique feature in the CASBEE family that is defined as "Value of products and services per unit environmental load." The systems score two factors; Q and LR. Q is the built envi- ronment quality that evaluates improvement in living amenity for the building users and LR is the reduction of built environ- ment load that evaluates reduction of negative aspects of envi- ronmental impact. BEE is calculated by dividing the total scores for Q by the total scores for LR. CASBEE-WO; how- ever, does not evaluate environmental load, so the BEE is not applied for the rating. Instead of BEE, a total score is defined. In each evaluation element, five achievement levels, level 1 to 5, are set. The middle one, level 3, can be credited when it meets the ordinal level in Japanese building stocks. The num- ber that subtracts 1 from the accredited level becomes the score in each element. For instance, 2 points are given when level 3 is accredited. The total score is calculated by multiply- ing the average points by 25. At the moment, any weightings are not set in each evaluation element. The full score is 100. In the first version, buildings that score more than 75 are rated to rank S, the excellent category. The score is equivalent so that the mean level of all the elements is 4 points. Buildings scoring over the threshold, 65, 50, and 40 are rated to rank A,
B+, and B-, respectively. Buildings scoring less than 40 are
grouped into the lowest level, C. In the assessment result
sheet, the mean levels in each main item and sub-item are also shown to check the building pros and cons.
The number of items has been thoughtfully discussed in an advisory committee organized with practitioners and academics through two phases of prior verification processes. The first verification was carried out on Dec 2017, and the correlations between the evaluation elements and the final scores for the rating system were analyzed.13 The number of the evaluation items was initially selected at this stage to make the system can properly evaluate the baseline buildings at this stage. The second verification was carried out in September 2018 as described on section 3.2 and the number of the items for the release version was slightly readjusted by checking whether baseline buildings at this stage can be rated into the proper ranks.

Evaluation categories and phases
Three categories are set according to the evaluation target space in the target building, and the applicants can select any categories for their certifications. Figure 2 shows the diagram of the available categories. The first category, pattern 1 in Japanese original version, only evaluates the building shell and core, including its common building services. The category is expected to be utilized by multi-tenant building owners to evaluate their building values. In Japanese buildings, building
owners provide tenant spaces with the condition that the tenant can use the space as is, and then, these features and basic inte- riors including ceilings and air-conditioning systems are also evaluated in this category. Some evaluate elements related to material expected to be equipped by each tenant, for example, Qw1-1.4 Work Environment, are not included in the evalua- tions of this category. The second category, pattern 2, adds the evaluation in the proprietary part into those in the first cate- gory. In case an arbitrary tenant demands to evaluate the work environment with the whole building features, this category will be selected. The building owners will apply in collabora- tion with their tenants. The whole evaluation elements are used for the certification. The third category, pattern 3, is similar to the second one, but it includes all building spaces. For instance, if the targeted building is occupied or owned by a single company, this category will be used.
Two certification phases, new construction and in operation,
are set. The former includes design, construction or completion stages and in operation for a year or less after completion. In this phase, some evaluation elements that need operations through a certain period, for example, Qw4-1.4 Maintenance Status, and the elements related to existing buildings alone, for example, Qw3-2.3 Measures against Existing non-Conforming Buildings, are excluded. The later one, in operation, targets building a year or more after the completion. Basically, all the evaluation elements should be checked.

Correlations with Workers Health
Relationship among CASBEE-WO, CASBEE-OHC, and WFun
A new CASBEE tool, CASBEE-Office Health Checklist (CAS- BEE-OHC), has been developed in parallel with CASBEE- WO. CASBEE-OHC is a survey tool using questionnaires to office workers to check their working environments from the viewpoint of health and workplace productivity.14 The ques- tionnaires correspond to the evaluation lists in CASBEE-WO. While CASBEE-WO is aimed to objectively check the work environment from the viewpoint of the building owners or managers, CASBEE-OHC is aimed to subjectively check it from the viewpoint of the workers. In this context, the correla- tions between CASBEE-WO and the workers' health in the target buildings will be guaranteed by checking the adequate correlations between CASBEE-OHC and the workers' health, as long as the working environment is properly evaluated by the worker according to the building's design and management intent.
On the CASBEE-OHC development process, a large-scale
survey was conducted in 2018 using 3552 responses to confirm the correlation between the evaluation results and the worker's health. Work Functioning Impairment Scale (WFun), a tool

developed as an original questionnaire that evaluates a work- er's health-related ability to complete his work tasks,15 is used to check the office worker's health status. Here, "Functioning" refers to "the ability of the individual to perform particular defined tasks."16 Significant correlations between scores in CASBEE-OHC and WFun outputs were found, showing the validity of CASBEE-OHC.

Preliminary survey to check the correlations with work func- tioning impairment
A preliminary survey directly to check the correlation between
CASBEE-WO and WFun was conducted in September 2018, before the official release of CASBEE-WO. The outline is shown in Table 2. CASBEE-WO in a preliminary version was used to evaluate 54 buildings and 52 of them are rated into each rank. In 13 buildings, WFun is used to check the 216 workers functioning impairment status. The properties of the survey buildings, floor area, and completed year are shown in Figure 3.
The results of ranks rated by CASBEE-WO and the WFun scores distribution in the 13 buildings are shown in Figure 4. Regarding CASBEE-WO, 4, 7, and 2 buildings are rated to rank S, A, and B-, respectively. Relatively high ranked buildings were selected in this survey because the building owners that
were interested in the development voluntarily cooperated the survey. There are 7 items in WFun. The 5 points are distributed into each item, and then the total score distributes between 7 and
35. The higher score means that a higher risk of work function- ing impairment appears. The respondents are divided into four groups followed by their scores. No work functioning impair- ment is observed in the group where the scores are less than 15.
Low work functioning impairment could be observed in the group scoring from 14 to 20. Middle and high impairments could fall in the scores 21-27 and 28-35, respectively.
In Figure 5, the frequency distributions of the WFun scores are shown. The cooperated workers are divided into two groups, a group of 50 cooperators who worked in buildings with rank S in CASBEE-WO and the others, who worked in other buildings. There are only 15 cooperators working in
buildings with rank B-; the workers in rank A and rank B- buildings are in the same group for the analysis. There are
clear differences in the respondent rate where no or high work functioning impairment is observed. The significant point is that no one in rank S buildings was observed in the group with high work functioning impairments.
In Figure 6, the WFun score distributions are compared as a box plot. A significant difference is observed in the mean scores. In these contexts, ranking of CASBEE-WO can prop- erly rate the building in terms of healthy work environment provisions in terms of work functioning impairment.
The results show that the S rank buildings have a special feature in term of work functioning impairment that has a clear correlation with wellness that the developed system aims to evaluate. Consequently, the adequacy of set threshold for the rank S is verified in a sense. As mentioned above, the most of building for this preliminary survey are rank S or A, then the adequacy of the other thresholds between other ranks should be discussed in the other works.

Certification Program
The certification program started in June of 2019. As its first step, a limited number of projects, 18 buildings, applied for

the first certification process. The buildings were examined by a technical committee organized by IBEC. They were certified and accredited CASBEE-WO ranks on November 28, 2019 and January 30, 2020. Nine of them were certified as Smart Wellness Offices. The certified building list was opened to the public through the website of IBEC.17 Twenty-three buildings, adding 5 to the first certified group, were shown at this moment (May 31, 2020). The applicants can choose whether to open the score details, and many of the certified buildings have showed their details. The sample is shown in Figure 7, the score sheet of a building named "Akasaka Intercity Air" located at the center of Tokyo that scored the highest, 91.4 points, among a building group on the first certificate process in the evaluation phase "in operation."
In Table 3, the mean level and the level distribution in each evaluation element among the 18 certificated buildings are shown. The certificated buildings in this first round are in a building group that are interested in wellness aspects or ESG investments. In this context, the trends in Japanese buildings that consider those aspects appear in the data. For example, most of the mean levels in "Qw1-1 Space and Interior" are over 4. This means that architects and building owners thoughtfully considered space and interior design to promote wellness aspects. On the other hand, the mean levels in Qw1-4 Thermal Comfort & Air Quality tend to be lower than the other items. Even though the owners and designers fulfil the minimum requirements in this aspect, there is room to improve their buildings and built environments in these aspects. In "Qw2-1.2 Comfort in Elevator Ride," there is a relatively large distribution and the mean level is relatively lower than the others. It is mainly due to the scoring system in the evaluation elements. It was designed for high-rise buildings with a certain number of elevators and tends to score low small buildings equipped with single or a few elevators. This mismatching has been fixed and a new version was released in May 2020.
Data of "2.3 Measures against Existing non-conforming
Buildings" in Qw3 is not shown in this table because only two buildings, existing buildings, use this evaluation items.

Conclusions
CASBEE-WO was launched in June 2019 as a new CASBEE tool to evaluate buildings and workplaces from the viewpoints of workers health, workplace productivity and resilience. In this paper, the tool's outline, including the development con- cept following a new social movement related to PRI and ESG investments, is introduced, as well as the structure of the eval- uation system. The technical background such as the

correlations with other evaluation tools, CASBEE-OHC and WFun, is also explained. The data show that the CASBEE- WO can properly evaluate buildings providing a work environ- ment to reduce the risk of a high work functioning impairment. The third-party certification process has been started and 23 buildings have been certified and accredited their CASBEE- WO ranks. The data for 18 buildings that were examined on the first certification process are shown and the distributions are analyzed. The results show that more actions can be imple- mented in the thermal comfort and air quality to promote well- ness of workers, while the building owners and designers have thoughtfully considered the space designs at the moment.
The new version was released in May 2020 to fix some defects found through the analysis. While the number and the term of certification applications had been limited until the release of the fixed version, the certification will be opened widely, and an increase in the number of certified buildings is expected. At the time when the tool becomes more popular and sufficient building data are accumulated, a further research is under planning to see the contribution to social require- ments. Through the analysis, the adjustments to overcome the limitations and difficulties will be done as well. Consequently, the intention of the tool development promoting ESG invest- ments based on objective evaluation systems will be realized in the near future. The benefits to use the developed system is also under verification through case studies.18
